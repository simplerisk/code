## Introduction

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI applications to interact with external data sources and tools through a uniform interface. MCP servers expose three core primitives:

- **Tools** -- Functions the AI model can invoke to perform actions (model-controlled)
- **Prompts** -- Reusable message templates the user can select (user-controlled)
- **Resources** -- Data that provides context to the model (application-controlled)

The `logiscape/mcp-sdk-php` SDK implements the MCP specification -- including the latest `2026-07-28` "stateless core" revision -- for PHP 8.1+. It provides a `McpServer` convenience wrapper that lets you build a fully functional MCP server in just a few lines of code. The same server file can run locally via stdio or remotely over HTTP -- making it deployable to standard cPanel/Apache hosting with zero infrastructure changes -- and serves **both protocol eras at once**: modern (`2026-07-28`) clients are served statelessly, one self-contained request at a time, while legacy clients (`2024-11-05` … `2025-11-25`) get the classic `initialize` handshake. You register features and call `run()`; the SDK detects each request's era (see [The 2026-07-28 Stateless Model](#the-2026-07-28-stateless-model)).

This guide teaches the `2026-07-28` model as the default and explicitly marks behavior that only exists on legacy revisions ("**legacy only**"). Servers can also request information back from the client mid-tool: elicitation (form mode since `2025-06-18`, URL mode since `2025-11-25`) and server-initiated LLM sampling work across both transports and both eras -- on the modern era via the spec's multi-round-trip input exchanges, on legacy HTTP via the SDK's suspend/resume plumbing; your tool code is identical either way (see [Part 8](#part-8-requesting-input-with-elicitation)). The `2026-07-28` extensions -- [Tasks](tasks.md) (long-running tool calls) and [MCP Apps](apps.md) (host-rendered tool UIs) -- each have their own guide.

### What You Can Build

- A local MCP server that Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP client launches as a subprocess
- A remote MCP server hosted on your web hosting that any MCP client connects to over HTTPS
- A dual-mode server that works both ways from a single PHP file

---

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- PHP 8.1 or higher
- Composer
- `ext-curl` and `ext-json` (typically enabled by default)
- For local/stdio servers: CLI access
- For remote/HTTP servers: Apache with `mod_rewrite` (standard on cPanel hosting)

### Installation

```bash
composer require logiscape/mcp-sdk-php
```

### Your First MCP Server

```php
<?php
// server.php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;

$server = new McpServer('my-first-server');
$server
    ->tool('hello', 'Say hello to someone', function (string $name): string {
        return "Hello, {$name}! Welcome to MCP.";
    })
    ->run();
```

The `run()` method detects the environment automatically:
- **CLI** (`php server.php`) -- uses the stdio transport for local MCP connections
- **Web server** (accessed via HTTP) -- uses the HTTP transport for remote MCP connections

You can also force a specific transport:
- `runStdio()` -- always use stdio
- `runHttp()` -- always use HTTP

### Connecting from Claude Desktop (Local)

Add to your Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "command": "php",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/server.php"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Connecting from an MCP Client (Remote)

Once deployed to a web server (covered in [Part 4](#part-4-deploying-remote-mcp-servers)), the MCP endpoint URL is simply the URL to your PHP file:

```
https://yoursite.com/mcp-server.php
```

## The 2026-07-28 Stateless Model

The `2026-07-28` spec revision removes connection state from the protocol:
there is no `initialize` handshake, no `Mcp-Session-Id` header, and no
server-held session. Every request is **self-contained** -- it carries the
protocol version and client capabilities (plus, optionally, client info)
in its `_meta` envelope -- and clients learn what a server offers from the
cacheable `server/discover` method. This is exactly the model that fits typical PHP
web hosting, where every HTTP request is served by a fresh process.

**None of this requires anything special in your server code.** You
register tools, prompts, and resources and call `run()`, exactly as in
every example in this guide. What the SDK does per request:

- **Era detection.** A request carrying the modern `_meta` envelope (or
  the modern `MCP-Protocol-Version` header) is served statelessly with
  `2026-07-28` semantics on a fresh, ephemeral context. A legacy
  `initialize` gets the classic handshake and session. One server file,
  both eras, concurrently.
- **`server/discover`.** Answered on stdio and HTTP with the same
  capabilities the legacy `initialize` result advertises -- without any
  prior handshake, fully sessionless, as a plain cacheable JSON response.
- **Removed methods.** Methods the stateless revision removed
  (`initialize`, `ping`, `logging/setLevel`,
  `resources/subscribe`/`unsubscribe`) answer `-32601` on the modern path
  (HTTP 404); legacy clients keep using them unchanged.
- **Caching hints (SEP-2549).** Modern list, read, and discover results
  carry the required `ttlMs` / `cacheScope` fields plus the `resultType`
  discriminator. The SDK stamps conservative defaults (`ttlMs: 0`,
  `cacheScope: "private"` -- never cache) and strips the fields for legacy
  clients. To advertise real cacheability, return a full result object
  from a low-level handler and call `setCacheHints(ttlMs, cacheScope)` on
  it (every cacheable result type implements
  `Mcp\Types\CacheableResult`).
- **Request-metadata headers (SEP-2243).** On HTTP, modern requests carry
  `Mcp-Method` and (on name-bearing methods) `Mcp-Name` headers that must
  match the body; the SDK validates them and rejects mismatches with
  `-32020`. See [Designated parameters](#designated-parameters-x-mcp-header-sep-2243)
  for the developer-visible piece.
- **Trace context (SEP-414).** The reserved `traceparent` / `tracestate` /
  `baggage` keys in `_meta` pass through untouched, with accessors on
  `Mcp\Types\TraceContext`.

**What is legacy-only** (kept fully working for `2024-11-05` …
`2025-11-25` clients, absent on the modern path): the `initialize`
handshake, the `Mcp-Session-Id` header and file-backed session state, the
standalone GET SSE stream, and `Last-Event-ID` stream resumption. Where
one of these appears later in this guide it is marked **legacy only**.

Try it: run [`examples/stateless_server.php`](../examples/stateless_server.php)
and connect with [`examples/client_negotiation.php`](../examples/client_negotiation.php)
in `--mode=modern` and `--mode=legacy` to watch the same server serve both
eras.

## Part 1: Tools

Tools are the most powerful MCP primitive. They let an AI model take action -- call an API, query a database, transform data, or interact with any system your PHP code can reach. The model discovers available tools, decides when to use them, and invokes them with the appropriate arguments.

### How Tools Work

1. The MCP client asks your server for its list of tools (`tools/list`)
2. The AI model sees each tool's name, description, and parameter schema
3. When the model decides to use a tool, the client sends a `tools/call` request
4. Your server executes the callback and returns the result

### Basic Tool

```php
<?php
// tools_basic.php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;

$server = new McpServer('basic-tools');

// A tool that converts temperature units.
// The SDK uses reflection to automatically build the JSON Schema
// from the callback's parameter types.
$server->tool(
    'convert-temperature',
    'Convert a temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit',
    function (float $value, string $unit): string {
        $unit = strtolower($unit);

        if ($unit === 'c' || $unit === 'celsius') {
            $result = ($value * 9 / 5) + 32;
            return "{$value}C = {$result}F";
        }

        if ($unit === 'f' || $unit === 'fahrenheit') {
            $result = ($value - 32) * 5 / 9;
            return "{$value}F = {$result}C";
        }

        return "Unknown unit '{$unit}'. Use 'C' or 'F'.";
    }
);

$server->run();
```

The SDK inspects the callback with PHP reflection and produces a JSON Schema that conforms to the [JSON Schema draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) dialect:
- `float $value` becomes `{ "type": "number" }` in the JSON Schema
- `string $unit` becomes `{ "type": "string" }`
- Required vs. optional is determined by whether the parameter has a default value
- The top-level schema is always `{ "type": "object" }` with `properties` and `required` populated from the callback's signature

Reflection-built schemas omit the `$schema` declaration -- 2020-12 is the assumed default for tool input schemas and adding it explicitly would be redundant. Hand-written schemas (covered in [Custom Input Schemas](#custom-input-schemas) below) are free to include `$schema` themselves and to use any 2020-12 keyword the spec defines, including `$defs`, `$ref`, `oneOf`/`anyOf`/`allOf`, `additionalProperties`, `patternProperties`, and `unevaluatedProperties`. The SDK enforces only the structural constraints the MCP spec requires of a tool input schema -- the top-level `type` must be `"object"`, `properties` (when present) must be a JSON object, and `required` (when present) must be an array of non-empty strings -- and passes every other keyword through to the wire unchanged.

Two known limits of the reflection path: the auto-generated `description` for each property is a placeholder (`"Parameter: <name>"`), and union types or nested objects collapse to plain `string` because the reflector can't represent richer structure without help. When either matters, override the schema with the `$inputSchema` parameter -- see [Custom Input Schemas](#custom-input-schemas).

### Tool with Optional Parameters

```php
<?php
// tools_optional.php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;

$server = new McpServer('optional-params');

// Parameters with default values become optional in the schema.
$server->tool(
    'search-products',
    'Search a product catalog by keyword',
    function (string $query, int $limit = 10, string $sort = 'relevance'): string {
        // In a real server, this would query a database.
        $results = [
            ['name' => 'Widget A', 'price' => 9.99],
            ['name' => 'Widget B', 'price' => 14.99],
            ['name' => 'Gadget C', 'price' => 24.99],
        ];

        $output = "Results for '{$query}' (limit: {$limit}, sort: {$sort}):\n";
        foreach (array_slice($results, 0, $limit) as $i => $product) {
            $output .= ($i + 1) . ". {$product['name']} - \${$product['price']}\n";
        }

        return $output;
    }
);

$server->run();
```

In this example `$query` is required, while `$limit` and `$sort` are optional and will use their default values if the model doesn't supply them.

### Tool with Error Handling

When an exception is thrown inside a tool callback, the SDK catches it and returns the error message to the model with `isError: true`. This lets the model self-correct rather than crashing the server.

```php
<?php
// tools_errors.php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;

$server = new McpServer('error-handling');

$server->tool(
    'divide',
    'Divide one number by another',
    function (float $numerator, float $denominator): string {
        if ($denominator == 0) {
            // Throwing an exception inside a tool callback returns the
            // error to the model as a tool execution error (isError: true).
            // This is intentional -- it lets the model understand what
            // went wrong and try a different approach.
            throw new \InvalidArgumentException(
                'Division by zero is not allowed. Please provide a non-zero denominator.'
            );
        }

        $result = $numerator / $denominator;
        return "{$numerator} / {$denominator} = {$result}";
    }
);

$server->run();
```

### Custom Input Schemas

Reflection covers the common case, but it can only describe what PHP's type system can express. When you need a richer schema -- nested objects, enums beyond `bool`, value constraints, custom descriptions for the model -- pass an `$inputSchema` to `tool()` and the SDK will use it instead of building one from the callback's signature. The SDK enforces the spec-required envelope before serialization (top-level `type: object`, well-formed `properties` and `required` -- see the rules below), and any other keyword you include rides alongside unchanged. This is also how you opt into JSON Schema 2020-12 features like `$defs`, `$ref`, `additionalProperties`, and `oneOf`/`anyOf`/`allOf`.

```php
<?php
// tools_custom_schema.php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;

$server = new McpServer('custom-schema');

$server->tool(
    name: 'create-user',
    description: 'Create a user record with a structured address',
    callback: function (string $name, array $address): string {
        return "Created user '{$name}' at {$address['street']}, {$address['city']}";
    },
    inputSchema: [
        '$schema' => 'https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema',
        'properties' => [
            'name'    => [
                'type'        => 'string',
                'description' => 'Full display name',
                'minLength'   => 1,
                'maxLength'   => 200,
            ],
            'address' => ['$ref' => '#/$defs/address'],
        ],
        'required'             => ['name', 'address'],
        'additionalProperties' => false,
        '$defs' => [
            'address' => [
                'type'       => 'object',
                'properties' => [
                    'street' => ['type' => 'string'],
                    'city'   => ['type' => 'string'],
                ],
                'required'             => ['street', 'city'],
                'additionalProperties' => false,
            ],
        ],
    ],
);

$server->run();
```

A few rules worth knowing:

- **The top-level `type` must be `"object"`.** The MCP spec requires this for tool input schemas, and the SDK enforces it: the `inputSchema` array is merged on top of `['type' => 'object']` so you can omit `type` entirely (the default kicks in), but if you do supply it, it must be exactly `"object"`. Passing any other value -- `"string"`, `"array"`, etc. -- causes `tool()` to throw `InvalidArgumentException` rather than silently overwriting it. Use `oneOf`/`anyOf` or nested `properties` to express richer shapes within the object envelope.
- **`properties` and `required` are shape-checked.** `properties` (when present) must be an associative array; `required` (when present) must be a list of non-empty strings. Anything else throws `InvalidArgumentException` at registration time. Every other keyword you supply -- `$schema`, `$defs`, `$ref`, `additionalProperties`, etc. -- is stored as-is and emitted verbatim on the wire.
- **`$schema` is optional but recommended for hand-written schemas.** MCP defaults to JSON Schema draft 2020-12 for tool input, so omitting `$schema` works -- but declaring it explicitly removes any ambiguity for spec-strict clients and signals intent to readers.
- **Reflection is bypassed entirely when `$inputSchema` is set.** Optional and required parameters in the PHP signature are ignored; the schema's `required` array is the source of truth.

### Tool Annotations

Tool annotations (spec revision `2025-03-26`) are optional behavioral hints describing how a tool interacts with its environment: is it read-only, destructive when it writes, idempotent on repeat calls, open-world in what it touches? Hosts use them to shape confirmation prompts, and connector directories (Claude, ChatGPT) check them against actual tool behavior during review. They are **hints, not guarantees** -- clients must never make security or trust decisions based on them, and your handler must still validate and authorize every call. (Not to be confused with two other "annotations" in MCP: the `x-mcp-header` *designated-parameter* annotations inside `inputSchema` -- see [Designated Parameters](#designated-parameters-x-mcp-header-sep-2243) -- and the content-block `Annotations` (audience/priority) on results.)

Pass an `annotations` array (or a prebuilt `Mcp\Types\ToolAnnotations`) to `tool()`:

```php
<?php
// tools_annotations.php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;

$server = new McpServer('annotated-tools');

$server->tool(
    name: 'delete-record',
    description: 'Permanently delete a record by ID',
    callback: fn(string $id): string => "Deleted record {$id}",
    title: 'Delete Record',
    annotations: [
        'readOnlyHint'    => false,
        'destructiveHint' => true,  // may perform irreversible changes
        'idempotentHint'  => true,  // repeating the same call adds no effect
        'openWorldHint'   => false, // closed domain -- no external entities
    ],
);

$server->run();
```

A few notes:

- **All five fields are optional** (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`, `title`); only the ones you set are emitted on the wire.
- **Prefer the top-level `title` parameter** for display names. `annotations['title']` also exists, but clients resolve display names as `title` → `annotations.title` → `name`, so the dedicated parameter always wins.
- **Version adaptation is automatic.** Annotations entered the spec in `2025-03-26`; for a client that negotiated `2024-11-05` the SDK strips them from `tools/list` while leaving every other tool field (title, icons, schemas, `_meta`) intact. No gating code needed on your side.

### Multiple Tools

Chain as many tools as you need. Each `->tool()` call returns the server instance for fluent chaining.

```php
<?php
// tools_multiple.php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;

$server = new McpServer('text-utilities');

$server
    ->tool('word-count', 'Count the words in a text', function (string $text): string {
        $count = str_word_count($text);
        return "The text contains {$count} word(s).";
    })
    ->tool('slugify', 'Convert text to a URL-friendly slug', function (string $text): string {
        $slug = strtolower(trim($text));
        $slug = preg_replace('/[^a-z0-9]+/', '-', $slug);
        $slug = trim($slug, '-');
        return $slug;
    })
    ->tool('extract-emails', 'Extract email addresses from text', function (string $text): string {
        preg_match_all('/[\w.\-]+@[\w.\-]+\.\w+/', $text, $matches);
        $emails = $matches[0];

        if (empty($emails)) {
            return 'No email addresses found.';
        }

        return "Found " . count($emails) . " email(s):\n" . implode("\n", $emails);
    })
    ->run();
```

---

## Part 2: Prompts

Prompts are reusable message templates that a user can select in their MCP client. Unlike tools (which the model calls autonomously), prompts are user-initiated -- they appear as slash commands or in a prompt library UI. Prompts are ideal for standardizing common interactions: code review templates, analysis frameworks, report formats, etc.

### How Prompts Work

1. The MCP client fetches available prompts (`prompts/list`)
2. The user selects a prompt (e.g., via a slash command)
3. The client sends `prompts/get` with the user's arguments
4. Your server returns one or more messages that seed the conversation

### Basic Prompt

```php
<?php
// prompts_basic.php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;

$server = new McpServer('basic-prompts');

// A prompt that generates a code review request.
// Like tools, arguments are auto-generated from the callback's parameters.
$server->prompt(
    'code-review',
    'Generate a structured code review request',
    function (string $language, string $code): string {
        return <<<PROMPT
        Please review the following {$language} code. Analyze it for:

        1. **Correctness** -- Are there any bugs or logic errors?
        2. **Security** -- Are there any vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, etc.)?
        3. **Performance** -- Are there any inefficiencies?
        4. **Readability** -- Is the code clean and well-structured?
        5. **Best Practices** -- Does it follow {$language} conventions?

        Code to review:
        ```{$language}
        {$code}
        ```
        PROMPT;
    }
);

$server->run();
```

When the callback returns a string, the SDK wraps it as a single user-role message. The model then responds to it as if the user had typed that message.

### Prompt Returning Multiple Messages

Return an array of strings to create a multi-message conversation starter:

```php
<?php
// prompts_multi_message.php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;

$server = new McpServer('multi-message-prompts');

// Returning an array produces multiple user messages.
$server->prompt(
    'debug-session',
    'Start a structured debugging session',
    function (string $error_message, string $context = 'web application'): array {
        return [
            "I'm encountering the following error in my {$context}:\n\n```\n{$error_message}\n```",
            "Please help me debug this step by step. Start by identifying the most likely root causes, then suggest specific diagnostic steps I can take.",
        ];
    }
);

$server->run();
```

### Advanced Prompt with Full Control

For full control over message roles and content types, return a `GetPromptResult` directly:

```php
<?php
// prompts_advanced.php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Types\GetPromptResult;
use Mcp\Types\PromptMessage;
use Mcp\Types\TextContent;
use Mcp\Types\Role;

$server = new McpServer('advanced-prompts');

// Returning a GetPromptResult gives full control over the message structure,
// including the ability to mix user and assistant roles.
$server->prompt(
    'sql-assistant',
    'Start an interactive SQL query building session',
    function (string $table_name, string $database_type = 'MySQL'): GetPromptResult {
        return new GetPromptResult(
            description: "SQL assistant for {$database_type}",
            messages: [
                new PromptMessage(
                    role: Role::USER,
                    content: new TextContent(
                        text: "I need help writing a {$database_type} query for the '{$table_name}' table."
                    )
                ),
                new PromptMessage(
                    role: Role::ASSISTANT,
                    content: new TextContent(
                        text: "I'd be happy to help you write a {$database_type} query for the '{$table_name}' table. To write the best query, could you tell me:\n\n1. What columns does the table have?\n2. What do you want the query to do? (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, aggregate, join, etc.)\n3. Are there any specific conditions or filters?"
                    )
                ),
            ]
        );
    }
);

$server->run();
```

By including an assistant message, you prime the model to continue in a specific conversational style.

### Prompts with Images or Embedded Resources

A prompt message is not limited to text. A `PromptMessage` can carry `TextContent`, `ImageContent`, `AudioContent`, or an `EmbeddedResource` -- useful when the template needs to seed the conversation with a screenshot, a diagram, or a file the model should reason about. The string and array shortcuts only ever produce text messages, so to include non-text content you build the `GetPromptResult` explicitly.

This prompt seeds the conversation with an image and asks the model to describe it:

```php
<?php
// prompts_image.php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Types\GetPromptResult;
use Mcp\Types\PromptMessage;
use Mcp\Types\TextContent;
use Mcp\Types\ImageContent;
use Mcp\Types\Role;

$server = new McpServer('image-prompts');

$server->prompt(
    'describe-logo',
    'Ask the model to describe the company logo',
    function (): GetPromptResult {
        // Set this to your actual image file
        $bytes = file_get_contents(__DIR__ . '/assets/logo.png');

        return new GetPromptResult(
            description: 'Logo description starter',
            messages: [
                new PromptMessage(
                    role: Role::USER,
                    content: new TextContent(text: 'Describe this logo in one sentence:'),
                ),
                // ImageContent carries base64-encoded image bytes and a MIME type.
                new PromptMessage(
                    role: Role::USER,
                    content: new ImageContent(
                        data: base64_encode($bytes),
                        mimeType: 'image/png',
                    ),
                ),
            ],
        );
    }
);

$server->run();
```

To embed a full resource instead -- a config file, a document, a record the model should treat as addressable context -- wrap a `TextResourceContents` (or `BlobResourceContents` for binary) in an `EmbeddedResource`:

```php
<?php
// prompts_embedded_resource.php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Types\GetPromptResult;
use Mcp\Types\PromptMessage;
use Mcp\Types\TextContent;
use Mcp\Types\EmbeddedResource;
use Mcp\Types\TextResourceContents;
use Mcp\Types\Role;

$server = new McpServer('embedded-prompts');

$server->prompt(
    'review-config',
    'Ask the model to review the current application configuration',
    function (): GetPromptResult {
        $config = json_encode(['debug' => false, 'cache' => 'redis'], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);

        return new GetPromptResult(
            messages: [
                new PromptMessage(
                    role: Role::USER,
                    content: new TextContent(text: 'Review this configuration for problems:'),
                ),
                // The embedded resource keeps its own URI so the model (and
                // client) can refer to it as addressable context, not loose text.
                new PromptMessage(
                    role: Role::USER,
                    content: new EmbeddedResource(
                        resource: new TextResourceContents(
                            text: $config,
                            uri: 'config://app.json',
                            mimeType: 'application/json',
                        ),
                    ),
                ),
            ],
        );
    }
);

$server->run();
```

Note the `TextResourceContents` argument order: `text` first, then `uri`, then the optional `mimeType`.

## Part 3: Resources

Resources expose data that provides context to the AI model. They are identified by URIs and can represent anything: files, database records, API responses, configuration, or live system data. Resources are typically loaded by the application (or user) rather than invoked by the model -- they're about providing information, not taking action.

### How Resources Work

1. The MCP client fetches available resources (`resources/list`)
2. The client or user selects resources to include as context
3. The client sends `resources/read` with the resource URI
4. Your server returns the content (text or binary)

### Basic Resource

```php
<?php
// resources_basic.php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;

$server = new McpServer('basic-resources');

// A text resource. When the callback returns a string,
// the SDK wraps it as TextResourceContents.
$server->resource(
    uri: 'config://app-settings',
    name: 'Application Settings',
    description: 'Current application configuration',
    callback: function (): string {
        // In production, this might read from a config file or database
        return json_encode([
            'app_name' => 'My Application',
            'version' => '2.1.0',
            'environment' => 'production',
            'features' => [
                'dark_mode' => true,
                'notifications' => true,
                'beta_features' => false,
            ],
        ], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);
    },
    mimeType: 'application/json'
);

$server->run();
```

### Multiple Resources

```php
<?php
// resources_multiple.php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;

$server = new McpServer('multi-resources');

$server
    ->resource(
        uri: 'docs://api-reference',
        name: 'API Reference',
        description: 'REST API endpoint documentation',
        callback: function (): string {
            return <<<'DOC'
            ## API Endpoints

            ### GET /api/users
            Returns a paginated list of users.
            Parameters: page (int), per_page (int, max 100)

            ### GET /api/users/{id}
            Returns a single user by ID.

            ### POST /api/users
            Creates a new user.
            Body: { "name": string, "email": string }

            ### PUT /api/users/{id}
            Updates an existing user.
            Body: { "name"?: string, "email"?: string }

            ### DELETE /api/users/{id}
            Deletes a user. Requires admin role.
            DOC;
        },
        mimeType: 'text/markdown'
    )
    ->resource(
        uri: 'schema://users-table',
        name: 'Users Table Schema',
        description: 'Database schema for the users table',
        callback: function (): string {
            return <<<'SQL'
            CREATE TABLE users (
                id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
                name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
                email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
                role ENUM('user', 'admin', 'moderator') DEFAULT 'user',
                created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
                updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
                INDEX idx_email (email),
                INDEX idx_role (role)
            );
            SQL;
        },
        mimeType: 'text/plain'
    )
    ->resource(
        uri: 'info://server-status',
        name: 'Server Status',
        description: 'Live server health information',
        callback: function (): string {
            return json_encode([
                'php_version' => PHP_VERSION,
                'memory_usage' => memory_get_usage(true),
                'memory_peak' => memory_get_peak_usage(true),
                'uptime' => @file_get_contents('/proc/uptime') ?: 'N/A',
                'disk_free' => disk_free_space('.'),
                'timestamp' => date('c'),
            ], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);
        },
        mimeType: 'application/json'
    )
    ->run();
```

### Binary Resource

When a callback returns an `SplFileObject` or a PHP stream resource, the SDK automatically base64-encodes it as a `BlobResourceContents`:

```php
<?php
// resources_binary.php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;

$server = new McpServer('binary-resources');

// Serve a binary file (e.g., a logo image).
// Returning an SplFileObject triggers base64 encoding.
$server->resource(
    uri: 'file://company-logo',
    name: 'Company Logo',
    description: 'The company logo in PNG format',
    callback: function (): \SplFileObject {
        $path = __DIR__ . '/assets/logo.png';
        return new \SplFileObject($path, 'r');
    },
    mimeType: 'image/png'
);

// Serve a dynamically generated CSV using a PHP stream resource
$server->resource(
    uri: 'file://report-csv',
    name: 'Monthly Report CSV',
    description: 'Generated CSV export of monthly report data',
    callback: function () {
        $stream = fopen('php://temp', 'r+');
        fputcsv($stream, ['Date', 'Revenue', 'Orders']);
        fputcsv($stream, ['2025-11-01', '12500.00', '145']);
        fputcsv($stream, ['2025-11-02', '13200.00', '162']);
        fputcsv($stream, ['2025-11-03', '11800.00', '138']);
        rewind($stream);
        return $stream;
    },
    mimeType: 'text/csv'
);

$server->run();
```

### Advanced Resource with Full Control

For full control over the response, return a `ReadResourceResult` directly:

```php
<?php
// resources_advanced.php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Types\ReadResourceResult;
use Mcp\Types\TextResourceContents;

$server = new McpServer('advanced-resources');

$server->resource(
    uri: 'multi://combined-context',
    name: 'Combined Context',
    description: 'Returns multiple content items in a single resource read',
    callback: function (): ReadResourceResult {
        return new ReadResourceResult(
            contents: [
                new TextResourceContents(
                    uri: 'multi://combined-context#schema',
                    text: 'CREATE TABLE orders (id INT PRIMARY KEY, total DECIMAL(10,2));',
                    mimeType: 'text/plain'
                ),
                new TextResourceContents(
                    uri: 'multi://combined-context#sample-data',
                    text: json_encode([
                        ['id' => 1, 'total' => 99.99],
                        ['id' => 2, 'total' => 149.50],
                    ]),
                    mimeType: 'application/json'
                ),
            ]
        );
    }
);

$server->run();
```

### Resource Templates

A *resource template* describes a whole family of resources with a single URI pattern instead of registering each URI one by one. When a client reads a URI that matches the pattern, the SDK extracts the variables from the URI and hands them to your callback. Templates are advertised through `resources/templates/list` so clients can discover the pattern, and matching `resources/read` calls are routed to your template handler automatically.

Register one with `resourceTemplate()`:

```php
<?php
// resource_template.php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;

$server = new McpServer('templated-resources');

// The {userId} placeholder matches a single path segment. When a client reads
// "users://42/profile", the SDK extracts userId = "42" and passes it to the
// callback by name -- the parameter name must match the template variable.
$server->resourceTemplate(
    uriTemplate: 'users://{userId}/profile',
    name: 'User Profile',
    callback: function (string $userId): string {
        // In a real server, look the user up in a database.
        return json_encode([
            'id'   => $userId,
            'name' => "User {$userId}",
            'tier' => 'standard',
        ], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);
    },
    description: 'Profile data for a given user ID',
    mimeType: 'application/json',
);

$server->run();
```

A few rules govern the template syntax:

- **`{var}` matches a single path segment** -- everything except `/`. Use it for IDs, slugs, and other single-segment values.
- **`{+var}` matches greedily, including `/`.** Use it for file-like paths whose value spans multiple segments. A template `files:///{+path}` reading `files:///docs/2026/report.txt` yields `path = "docs/2026/report.txt"`.
- **Variables arrive as named parameters.** The SDK matches each template variable to a callback parameter by name (not position) using reflection, so name your parameters to match the placeholders. Percent-encoded values are decoded for you.
- **Only those two forms are supported.** Other RFC 6570 operators (`{?query}`, `{#frag}`, `{var:3}`, `{a,b}`, etc.) throw `InvalidArgumentException` at registration time, so the server never advertises a pattern it can't actually match.

Here is the multi-segment form:

```php
$server->resourceTemplate(
    uriTemplate: 'files:///{+path}',
    name: 'Project File',
    callback: function (string $path): string {
        // {+path} captures the full remainder, so reading
        // files:///docs/guide.md gives $path === 'docs/guide.md'.
        return "Contents of {$path}";
    },
);
```

Two things worth knowing:

- An exact resource registered with `resource()` always wins over a template; templates are tried in registration order only when no exact URI matches.
- The content the SDK returns carries the **concrete** request URI (e.g. `users://42/profile`), not the template pattern.

To suggest values for a template's variables as the user types, pair it with a completion provider -- see [Part 10](#part-10-providing-completions).

### Interactive UI with MCP Apps

The MCP Apps extension (SEP-1865) lets a tool ship an interactive HTML
view that a capable host renders in a sandboxed iframe. The
`McpServer::ui()` helper bundles the whole convention -- the `ui://`
template resource, the tool's `_meta.ui` link, and the extension
declaration -- into one call:

```php
$server->ui(
    tool: 'get_weather',
    uri: 'ui://weather/dashboard',
    name: 'Weather Dashboard',
    html: file_get_contents(__DIR__ . '/dashboard.html'),
);
```

The full story -- the view document's postMessage protocol, host hints
(`visibility`, `csp`, `permissions`, `domain`, `prefersBorder`), the
`structuredContent` pattern, and graceful degradation -- is in the
[**Apps Extension Guide**](apps.md), with a complete runnable example in
[`examples/apps_server/`](../examples/apps_server/).

## Part 4: Deploying Remote MCP Servers

One of the great strengths of this PHP SDK is that remote MCP servers work on standard shared hosting -- the same cPanel/Apache environment that runs millions of PHP sites. No special server software, no long-running processes, no WebSockets.

### How It Works

The SDK's HTTP transport is designed for PHP's traditional request-response lifecycle:

1. The MCP client sends HTTP POST requests to your PHP file
2. Apache/PHP processes each request independently
3. The SDK handles all JSON-RPC protocol details

For modern (`2026-07-28`) clients this is a perfect fit with **no state at
all**: every request is self-contained, so nothing needs to be persisted
between requests. For legacy clients (**legacy only**) the SDK persists
the `initialize` handshake's session state to files between requests --
that is what the session store and `mcp_sessions/` directory below are
for. A server that only ever expects modern clients still works with the
defaults; the session machinery simply never engages.

### Minimal Remote Server

```php
<?php
// mcp-server.php -- deploy this to your web hosting
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;

$server = new McpServer('my-remote-server');

$server
    ->tool('server-time', 'Get the current server time', function (string $timezone = 'UTC'): string {
        try {
            $tz = new \DateTimeZone($timezone);
        } catch (\Exception $e) {
            throw new \InvalidArgumentException("Invalid timezone: {$timezone}");
        }
        $now = new \DateTime('now', $tz);
        return $now->format('Y-m-d H:i:s T');
    })
    ->run();
```

Because `run()` detects the environment, this same file works locally via `php mcp-server.php` *and* remotely when accessed via `https://yoursite.com/mcp-server.php`.

### Deployment to cPanel Hosting

1. **Upload files** -- Upload your project (including `vendor/`) to a directory inside `public_html/`

2. **Directory structure**:
   ```
   public_html/
   └── mcp/
       ├── vendor/
       │   └── ...
       ├── mcp_sessions/     (auto-created, must be writable)
       ├── mcp-server.php
       └── .htaccess
   ```

3. **Create `.htaccess`** for clean URL and security:
   ```apache
   # Deny access to sensitive directories
   <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
       RewriteEngine On

       # Block direct access to vendor and session directories
       RewriteRule ^vendor/ - [F,L]
       RewriteRule ^mcp_sessions/ - [F,L]
   </IfModule>
   ```

4. **Verify PHP version** -- Ensure PHP 8.1+ is selected in cPanel's "MultiPHP Manager"

5. **Test** -- Your MCP endpoint is now live at:
   ```
   https://yoursite.com/mcp/mcp-server.php
   ```

### Configuring HTTP Options

For more control over the HTTP transport:

```php
<?php
// mcp-server-configured.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Server\Transport\Http\FileSessionStore;

$server = new McpServer('configured-server');

$server
    ->httpOptions([
        'session_timeout' => 1800,     // 30-minute session timeout
        'max_queue_size' => 500,       // Message queue limit
        'enable_sse' => false,         // Plain JSON responses (default; see "Streaming and graceful fallback" below)
        'shared_hosting' => true,      // Optimize for shared hosting
        'server_header' => 'My-MCP-Server/1.0',
        'allowed_origins' => ['yoursite.com'],  // DNS rebinding protection (see below)
    ])
    ->sessionStore(new FileSessionStore(__DIR__ . '/mcp_sessions'))
    ->tool('ping', 'Check if the server is alive', function (): string {
        return 'pong';
    })
    ->run();
```

### Streaming and Graceful Fallback

The HTTP transport can respond to a single POST in one of three wire formats: a plain JSON body, a buffered `text/event-stream` body (one HTTP response that happens to be SSE-framed), or a live-flushed SSE stream that emits frames as the tool runs. Two settings control which one a given request gets:

> **Era note:** everything in this section applies to both protocol eras,
> with one difference in shape. On the modern (`2026-07-28`) path a
> response stream is **request-scoped**: notifications your handler emits
> stream first, then the final response ends the stream, and there are no
> event ids and no `Last-Event-ID` resumption. Error responses are always
> plain JSON (the SEP-2575 error statuses cannot ride a committed SSE
> stream), and `server/discover` responses are deliberately never
> SSE-framed. The standalone GET SSE stream and resumable replay described
> later are **legacy only**; the modern era's standing channel is
> [`subscriptions/listen`](#publishing-change-notifications-subscriptionslisten)
> instead.

- `enable_sse` (default `false`) is the **master switch**. While it's off, every POST gets a plain JSON response regardless of what the client asked for -- this is the safe default for compatibility with arbitrary shared hosts. Set it to `true` to let the transport negotiate SSE with clients that advertise `text/event-stream` in their `Accept` header. The default is intentionally conservative because every spec-compliant MCP client lists both media types in `Accept`, so flipping to SSE silently would change the wire `Content-Type` on every deployment.
- `sse_mode` (default `'auto'`) is a **secondary mode** that only kicks in once SSE has been enabled and the transport has chosen SSE for a given request. It decides between buffered and live-flushed framing. When `enable_sse => false` it has no effect.

Live flushing needs a PHP runtime that actually delivers `flush()` output to the client, which is not a given on shared hosting -- `zlib.output_compression`, SAPI-owned `output_buffering`, `mod_deflate`, and a few similar settings will swallow flushes or interleave compressed chunks with the SSE framing. The SDK detects all of that automatically. `Environment::canStreamSse()` walks the output buffer stack and checks each relevant ini setting; if anything would break live streaming, the transport silently downgrades to the buffered body. No request ever hangs waiting for a flush the environment refuses to deliver, and the client always gets a spec-compliant response.

To opt into SSE and pick a mode:

```php
$server->httpOptions([
    'enable_sse' => true,   // required to respond with text/event-stream
    'sse_mode'   => 'auto', // 'auto' | 'streaming' | 'buffered'
]);
```

The modes behave as follows (after `enable_sse => true`):

- `'auto'` (default) -- live-flush when (a) the runtime supports it *and* (b) the client's request carries a `_meta.progressToken`, otherwise buffer. Short JSON-RPC round-trips stay on the simpler buffered path; live streaming is reserved for tools that actually emit progress.
- `'streaming'` -- live-flush whenever the runtime permits; fall back to buffered only when it does not.
- `'buffered'` -- always buffer, even on FrankenPHP or RoadRunner where live streaming would work. Use this when you specifically want the SSE wire format without any mid-response flushing.

If you leave `enable_sse => false` (the default), the server never emits SSE and the `sse_mode` setting is ignored. That is the right call for the widest shared-hosting compatibility; only flip it on when you have a reason to (long-running tools emitting progress, clients that explicitly prefer SSE, etc.).

### Transport Support: Streamable HTTP Only

The SDK implements the modern **Streamable HTTP** transport -- a single endpoint that accepts JSON-RPC over POST and can answer with either plain JSON or SSE, as described above. This is the transport the current spec defines.

It does **not** implement the deprecated **HTTP+SSE dual-endpoint** transport from the `2024-11-05` revision -- the older design that used a separate long-lived `GET /sse` stream alongside a separate POST endpoint. The spec deprecated that transport in favor of Streamable HTTP, and this SDK targets only the modern form.

The practical consequence is narrow: a client that speaks *only* the old dual-endpoint transport cannot connect to a server built with this SDK over HTTP. This is intentional and does not reduce Streamable HTTP coverage -- any client implementing the current transport connects normally, and protocol-version negotiation still lets the server speak older *protocol* revisions (including `2024-11-05` message shapes) over the modern transport.

### Designated Parameters (`x-mcp-header`, SEP-2243)

On the modern (`2026-07-28`) era, HTTP requests carry request-metadata
headers (`Mcp-Method` on every request, `Mcp-Name` on name-bearing ones)
that the SDK emits and validates for you -- a mismatch with the body is
rejected `400` / `-32020` before your code runs. The one piece with a
developer-visible surface is **designated parameters**: annotating a tool
input-schema property with `x-mcp-header` asks conformant clients to
mirror that argument into an `Mcp-Param-{name}` HTTP header, where
gateways and proxies can route or rate-limit on it without parsing the
JSON body:

```php
$server->tool(
    name: 'query-tenant-data',
    description: 'Query data scoped to a tenant',
    callback: function (string $tenantId, string $query): string {
        return "Results for {$tenantId}: …";
    },
    inputSchema: [
        'properties' => [
            // Mirrored to the `Mcp-Param-tenant-id` request header.
            'tenantId' => ['type' => 'string', 'x-mcp-header' => 'tenant-id'],
            'query'    => ['type' => 'string'],
        ],
        'required' => ['tenantId', 'query'],
    ],
);
```

The rules the SDK enforces (rejecting violations `-32020` server-side,
and refusing to emit them client-side):

- Only `string`, `integer`, and `boolean` properties may be designated
  (`number` is prohibited); integers are bounded to ±(2⁵³−1).
- The annotation value supplies the `{name}` part verbatim and must be an
  RFC 9110 token; names must be unique case-insensitively across the
  whole schema (annotations are honored at any nesting depth).
- The header must match the body's value exactly: strings as-is, integers
  as decimal, booleans as lowercase `true`/`false`; unsafe values ride a
  lowercase `=?base64?…?=` sentinel.

Designation is opt-in per property and only meaningful over HTTP (stdio
has no headers). Tools without annotations need nothing -- `Mcp-Method` /
`Mcp-Name` handling is fully automatic.

### DNS Rebinding Protection

The MCP spec requires servers to validate the `Origin` header to prevent [DNS rebinding attacks](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/transports#security-warning). The SDK handles this automatically for local development servers and provides the `allowed_origins` config option for remote deployments.

**Local servers (PHP built-in server):** Protection is auto-enabled. When you run `php -S localhost:3000 server.php`, the SDK automatically rejects requests from non-localhost origins. No configuration needed.

**Remote servers (Apache, nginx, etc.):** You should set `allowed_origins` to the hostname(s) your server is accessible from. This is important when browser-based MCP clients connect to your server, since browsers send `Origin` headers that will be validated:

```php
$server->httpOptions([
    'allowed_origins' => ['mcp.example.com'],
]);
```

The values are hostnames (not full URLs), and matching is port-agnostic. Multiple hostnames are supported:

```php
$server->httpOptions([
    'allowed_origins' => ['mcp.example.com', 'staging.example.com'],
]);
```

If `allowed_origins` is not set on a production web server, Origin validation is disabled and browser origins are not restricted. This may be acceptable for deployments that only serve non-browser MCP clients and rely on OAuth bearer tokens, but browser-accessible HTTP endpoints should configure `allowed_origins` so the server can reject unexpected web origins.

### Production Hardening

```php
<?php
// production-server.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Server\Transport\Http\FileSessionStore;

// Suppress warnings in production (MCP protocol uses stdout)
error_reporting(E_ERROR | E_PARSE);
ini_set('display_errors', '0');
ini_set('log_errors', '1');
ini_set('error_log', __DIR__ . '/logs/mcp-error.log');

$server = new McpServer('production-server');

$server
    ->httpOptions([
        'session_timeout' => 3600,
        'shared_hosting' => true,
    ])
    ->sessionStore(new FileSessionStore(__DIR__ . '/mcp_sessions'))
    ->tool('status', 'Get server status', function (): string {
        return json_encode([
            'status' => 'healthy',
            'version' => '1.0.0',
            'timestamp' => date('c'),
        ]);
    })
    ->run();
```

### Connection Health and Cancellation

Two protocol-level concerns are worth knowing about even though the convenience wrapper handles most of the work for you.

**Pings.** MCP defines a `ping` request/response pair distinct from any application-level "ping" tool a server might expose -- it's a no-argument health check that lets either side verify the connection is still live. The SDK auto-registers a built-in ping handler on every `Server` instance that returns the empty result the spec mandates, so a client calling `sendPing()` against an `McpServer` works out of the box with no code on your part. There is nothing to configure and nothing to register; the handler is wired in `Mcp\Server\Server::__construct()` before any of your tool/prompt/resource registrations run.

**Cancellation.** When a client decides to abort an in-flight request -- the user clicked cancel, a higher-level orchestrator timed out, the model produced a tool call the user rejected -- it sends a `notifications/cancelled` carrying the `requestId` it wants stopped. Per the [spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/utilities/cancellation), the receiver SHOULD stop processing, free associated resources, and **not send a response** for the cancelled request. The SDK delivers the notification through the hook below; the actual decision to stop work is yours.

The SDK gives you the lower-level `Server::registerNotificationHandler()` hook to receive the notification. Keep in mind that PHP's synchronous, single-threaded execution means the SDK cannot interrupt a tool that is already running its own code -- the handler fires only when the SDK is next reading from the transport, never *during* a busy handler. So the realistic use is bookkeeping and cleanup (recording which request IDs the client abandoned, freeing resources, suppressing follow-up notifications), not preempting work in progress:

```php
<?php
// cancellation_handler.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Types\NotificationParams;

$server = new McpServer('cancellation-aware');

// Application-owned cancellation set; keys are the integer request IDs the
// client asked to stop. Your own cleanup/logging code consults it.
$cancelled = [];

// Register the notification handler on the underlying Server instance.
// The handler receives a NotificationParams whose `requestId` field carries
// the integer request ID the client wants cancelled.
$server->getServer()->registerNotificationHandler(
    'notifications/cancelled',
    function (?NotificationParams $params) use (&$cancelled): void {
        if ($params === null || !isset($params->requestId)) {
            return;
        }
        // Record the abandoned request ID. The SDK will not interrupt a
        // running tool for you; consult this set from your own cleanup or
        // logging code once control returns to the SDK's message loop.
        $cancelled[(int) $params->requestId] = true;
    }
);

$server->run();
```

A few things worth knowing:

- **No mid-tool preemption.** Over stdio the message loop dispatches one message at a time, so a cancellation that arrives while your tool is running is only seen *after* the tool returns -- by which point its response has usually already been sent. Over HTTP on standard shared hosting each POST runs in its own process with its own memory, so an in-memory flag is neither shared across requests nor readable by an already-running handler. Either way the SDK cannot abort a tool from the outside; honoring a cancel is cooperative and only possible at points where your own code chooses to check.
- **There is no acknowledgement.** Don't try to send a response from the notification handler; cancels are notifications, not requests, and writing back will produce an invalid JSON-RPC frame.

For most servers no handler is needed at all -- the protocol still works correctly without it, the cancel is just ignored. That is explicitly allowed: the [spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/utilities/cancellation) says a receiver MAY ignore a cancellation whose request has already completed or cannot be cancelled. For long-running work with a real cancellation surface (`tasks/cancel`), use the Tasks extension (`enableTasks()`) -- see the [Tasks Extension Guide](tasks.md).

## Part 5: Securing Remote Servers with OAuth

Remote MCP servers are publicly accessible over HTTP, so authentication is essential. The MCP specification uses OAuth 2.1 for authorization. In this model, your MCP server acts as a **resource server** that validates tokens issued by an external **authorization server** (Auth0, Okta, Keycloak, Azure AD, or any OAuth 2.1 / OpenID Connect provider).

The SDK provides built-in JWT validation. You don't need to implement the OAuth flow yourself -- your authorization provider handles token issuance, and the SDK validates incoming tokens on every request.

### Architecture Overview

```
MCP Client                  Authorization Server          Your MCP Server
    |                         (Auth0, Okta, etc.)          (PHP + SDK)
    |                               |                          |
    |-- 1. Get access token ------->|                          |
    |<-- 2. Access token -----------|                          |
    |                               |                          |
    |-- 3. MCP request + Bearer token ----------------------->|
    |                               |                          |-- 4. Validate JWT
    |                               |                          |   (verify signature,
    |                               |                          |    check issuer, audience,
    |                               |                          |    expiry)
    |<-- 5. MCP response ------------------------------------ |
```

The SDK handles step 4 automatically. You configure it with your provider's details.

### Using the Built-in JWT Validator

#### With RS256 / JWKS (Recommended for Production)

Most providers (Auth0, Okta, Keycloak, Azure AD, Google) use RS256 with a JWKS endpoint. The SDK fetches the public keys automatically.

```php
<?php
// secured-server-rs256.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Server\Auth\JwtTokenValidator;

$server = new McpServer('secured-server');

// Configure JWT validation for your provider.
// Replace these values with your actual authorization server details.
$tokenValidator = new JwtTokenValidator(
    key: '',                        // Not used for JWKS-based validation
    algorithm: 'RS256',
    issuer: 'https://your-tenant.auth0.com/',
    audience: 'https://yoursite.com/mcp-server.php',
    jwksUri: 'https://your-tenant.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json'
);

$server
    ->withAuth(
        tokenValidator: $tokenValidator,
        authorizationServers: 'https://your-tenant.auth0.com/',
        resourceId: 'https://yoursite.com/mcp-server.php'
    )
    ->tool('protected-data', 'Access protected data', function (): string {
        return 'This data is only accessible with a valid token.';
    })
    ->run();
```

#### With HS256 (Simpler Setup)

HS256 uses a shared secret and is simpler to configure for development or when your provider supports it:

```php
<?php
// secured-server-hs256.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Server\Auth\JwtTokenValidator;

$server = new McpServer('secured-server');

$tokenValidator = new JwtTokenValidator(
    key: 'your-shared-secret-at-least-32-characters-long',
    algorithm: 'HS256',
    issuer: 'https://your-auth-server.com/',
    audience: 'https://yoursite.com/mcp-server.php'
);

$server
    ->withAuth(
        tokenValidator: $tokenValidator,
        authorizationServers: 'https://your-auth-server.com/',
        resourceId: 'https://yoursite.com/mcp-server.php'
    )
    ->tool('protected-data', 'Access protected data', function (): string {
        return 'Authenticated access granted.';
    })
    ->run();
```

### Provider-Specific Configuration

Provider configurations can change over time, consult the official documentation from your provider for the latest details.

#### Auth0

```php
$tokenValidator = new JwtTokenValidator(
    key: '',
    algorithm: 'RS256',
    issuer: 'https://YOUR_TENANT.auth0.com/',
    audience: 'https://yoursite.com/mcp-server.php',    // Must match the API Identifier in Auth0
    jwksUri: 'https://YOUR_TENANT.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json'
);
```

#### Okta

```php
$tokenValidator = new JwtTokenValidator(
    key: '',
    algorithm: 'RS256',
    issuer: 'https://YOUR_ORG.okta.com/oauth2/default',
    audience: 'https://yoursite.com/mcp-server.php',
    jwksUri: 'https://YOUR_ORG.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/keys'
);
```

#### Keycloak

```php
$tokenValidator = new JwtTokenValidator(
    key: '',
    algorithm: 'RS256',
    issuer: 'https://keycloak.example.com/realms/YOUR_REALM',
    audience: 'your-mcp-client-id',
    jwksUri: 'https://keycloak.example.com/realms/YOUR_REALM/protocol/openid-connect/certs'
);
```

#### Azure AD (Entra ID)

```php
$tokenValidator = new JwtTokenValidator(
    key: '',
    algorithm: 'RS256',
    issuer: 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/YOUR_TENANT_ID/v2.0',
    audience: 'api://your-app-client-id',
    jwksUri: 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/YOUR_TENANT_ID/discovery/v2.0/keys'
);
```

### Using a Custom Token Validator

For providers or flows that don't use standard JWT, implement `TokenValidatorInterface`:

```php
<?php
// custom-validator-server.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Server\Auth\TokenValidatorInterface;
use Mcp\Server\Auth\TokenValidationResult;

// Example: validate tokens by calling your provider's introspection endpoint
class IntrospectionTokenValidator implements TokenValidatorInterface
{
    public function __construct(
        private string $introspectionUrl,
        private string $clientId,
        private string $clientSecret
    ) {}

    public function validate(string $token): TokenValidationResult
    {
        $ch = curl_init($this->introspectionUrl);
        curl_setopt_array($ch, [
            CURLOPT_POST => true,
            CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS => http_build_query([
                'token' => $token,
                'client_id' => $this->clientId,
                'client_secret' => $this->clientSecret,
            ]),
            CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true,
            CURLOPT_TIMEOUT => 10,
        ]);

        $response = curl_exec($ch);
        $httpCode = curl_getinfo($ch, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE);
        curl_close($ch);

        if ($httpCode !== 200 || $response === false) {
            return new TokenValidationResult(
                valid: false,
                error: 'Token introspection request failed'
            );
        }

        $data = json_decode($response, true);

        if (!($data['active'] ?? false)) {
            return new TokenValidationResult(
                valid: false,
                error: 'Token is not active'
            );
        }

        return new TokenValidationResult(
            valid: true,
            claims: $data
        );
    }
}

$server = new McpServer('custom-auth-server');

$validator = new IntrospectionTokenValidator(
    introspectionUrl: 'https://your-auth-server.com/oauth2/introspect',
    clientId: 'your-client-id',
    clientSecret: 'your-client-secret'
);

$server
    ->withAuth($validator, 'https://your-auth-server.com/', 'https://yoursite.com/mcp-server.php')
    ->tool('whoami', 'Show the authenticated user info', function (): string {
        return 'You are authenticated.';
    })
    ->run();
```

### Configuring Apache (.htaccess) for OAuth

Add the following rules to your `.htaccess` file in the document root:

```apache
# 1. Pass Authorization header to PHP (REQUIRED for MCP)
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.*)
RewriteRule .* - [e=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%1]

# 2. Route .well-known endpoint to your MCP server
RewriteRule ^\.well-known/oauth-protected-resource(/.*)?$ /server_auth.php [L]
```

**Why This Is Necessary:**
- Many shared hosting environments strip the `Authorization` header by default
- The first rule ensures OAuth bearer tokens reach your PHP scripts
- The second rule enables OAuth discovery via the well-known endpoint

---

## Part 6: Structured Output

Tools can define an `outputSchema` to return machine-readable structured data alongside human-readable text. When an `outputSchema` is set and the callback returns an array or object, the SDK populates both `content` (text for the model) and `structuredContent` (validated JSON for programmatic use).

```php
<?php
// structured_output.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;

$server = new McpServer('structured-output');

$server->tool(
    name: 'analyze-url',
    description: 'Parse and analyze a URL into its components',
    callback: function (string $url): array {
        $parts = parse_url($url);
        if ($parts === false) {
            throw new \InvalidArgumentException("Invalid URL: {$url}");
        }

        return [
            'scheme' => $parts['scheme'] ?? '',
            'host' => $parts['host'] ?? '',
            'port' => $parts['port'] ?? null,
            'path' => $parts['path'] ?? '/',
            'query' => $parts['query'] ?? null,
            'fragment' => $parts['fragment'] ?? null,
            'is_secure' => ($parts['scheme'] ?? '') === 'https',
        ];
    },
    outputSchema: [
        'type' => 'object',
        'properties' => [
            'scheme' => ['type' => 'string'],
            'host' => ['type' => 'string'],
            'port' => ['type' => ['integer', 'null']],
            'path' => ['type' => 'string'],
            'query' => ['type' => ['string', 'null']],
            'fragment' => ['type' => ['string', 'null']],
            'is_secure' => ['type' => 'boolean'],
        ],
        'required' => ['scheme', 'host', 'path', 'is_secure'],
    ]
);

$server->tool(
    name: 'calculate-statistics',
    description: 'Calculate basic statistics for a list of comma-separated numbers',
    callback: function (string $numbers): array {
        $values = array_map('floatval', explode(',', $numbers));
        $count = count($values);

        if ($count === 0) {
            throw new \InvalidArgumentException('No numbers provided.');
        }

        sort($values);
        $sum = array_sum($values);
        $mean = $sum / $count;
        $median = ($count % 2 === 0)
            ? ($values[$count / 2 - 1] + $values[$count / 2]) / 2
            : $values[(int) floor($count / 2)];

        return [
            'count' => $count,
            'sum' => $sum,
            'mean' => round($mean, 4),
            'median' => $median,
            'min' => min($values),
            'max' => max($values),
        ];
    },
    outputSchema: [
        'type' => 'object',
        'properties' => [
            'count' => ['type' => 'integer'],
            'sum' => ['type' => 'number'],
            'mean' => ['type' => 'number'],
            'median' => ['type' => 'number'],
            'min' => ['type' => 'number'],
            'max' => ['type' => 'number'],
        ],
        'required' => ['count', 'sum', 'mean', 'median', 'min', 'max'],
    ]
);

$server->run();
```

## Part 7: Returning Rich Content

Tool callbacks can return a `CallToolResult` directly for full control over the response, including images, multiple content items, and error flags.

### Returning Images

```php
<?php
// rich_content_image.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Types\CallToolResult;
use Mcp\Types\TextContent;
use Mcp\Types\ImageContent;

$server = new McpServer('image-tools');

$server->tool(
    'generate-placeholder',
    'Generate a placeholder image with specified dimensions and return it',
    function (int $width = 200, int $height = 200, string $color = '4A90D9'): CallToolResult {
        // Create a simple colored rectangle using GD
        $image = imagecreatetruecolor($width, $height);
        $r = hexdec(substr($color, 0, 2));
        $g = hexdec(substr($color, 2, 2));
        $b = hexdec(substr($color, 4, 2));
        $fill = imagecolorallocate($image, $r, $g, $b);
        imagefill($image, 0, 0, $fill);

        // Add dimension text
        $white = imagecolorallocate($image, 255, 255, 255);
        $text = "{$width}x{$height}";
        $fontSize = 4;
        $textWidth = imagefontwidth($fontSize) * strlen($text);
        $textHeight = imagefontheight($fontSize);
        $x = ($width - $textWidth) / 2;
        $y = ($height - $textHeight) / 2;
        imagestring($image, $fontSize, (int) $x, (int) $y, $text, $white);

        // Capture PNG output
        ob_start();
        imagepng($image);
        $imageData = ob_get_clean();
        imagedestroy($image);

        return new CallToolResult(
            content: [
                new TextContent(text: "Generated a {$width}x{$height} placeholder image with color #{$color}."),
                new ImageContent(
                    data: base64_encode($imageData),
                    mimeType: 'image/png'
                ),
            ]
        );
    }
);

$server->run();
```

### Returning Multiple Content Items

```php
<?php
// rich_content_multi.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Types\CallToolResult;
use Mcp\Types\TextContent;

$server = new McpServer('multi-content');

$server->tool(
    'system-report',
    'Generate a comprehensive system report with multiple sections',
    function (): CallToolResult {
        $phpInfo = "PHP Version: " . PHP_VERSION . "\n"
            . "SAPI: " . PHP_SAPI . "\n"
            . "OS: " . PHP_OS . "\n"
            . "Extensions: " . implode(', ', get_loaded_extensions());

        $memoryInfo = "Memory Usage: " . round(memory_get_usage(true) / 1024 / 1024, 2) . " MB\n"
            . "Peak Memory: " . round(memory_get_peak_usage(true) / 1024 / 1024, 2) . " MB\n"
            . "Memory Limit: " . ini_get('memory_limit');

        $diskInfo = "Disk Free: " . round(disk_free_space('.') / 1024 / 1024 / 1024, 2) . " GB\n"
            . "Disk Total: " . round(disk_total_space('.') / 1024 / 1024 / 1024, 2) . " GB";

        return new CallToolResult(
            content: [
                new TextContent(text: "## PHP Environment\n{$phpInfo}"),
                new TextContent(text: "## Memory\n{$memoryInfo}"),
                new TextContent(text: "## Disk\n{$diskInfo}"),
            ]
        );
    }
);

$server->run();
```

> **Wrap non-text content in a result object.** The convenience wrapper only auto-coerces `string` returns into a `CallToolResult` (plus, for tools that declare an `outputSchema`, the structured-output coercion described in [Part 6: Structured Output](#part-6-structured-output)). Returning anything else -- a bare `array`, `AudioContent`, `ImageContent`, or `EmbeddedResource` -- will throw an invalid-result error; always wrap it in a `CallToolResult` as shown here.

### Returning Audio

`AudioContent` carries base64-encoded audio just as `ImageContent` carries images. Return it inside a `CallToolResult`:

```php
<?php
// rich_content_audio.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Types\CallToolResult;
use Mcp\Types\TextContent;
use Mcp\Types\AudioContent;

$server = new McpServer('audio-tools');

$server->tool(
    'text-to-speech',
    'Synthesize speech for a short phrase and return it as audio',
    function (string $text): CallToolResult {
        // A real tool would call a TTS engine; you can also set this to a pre-rendered clip.
        $wav = file_get_contents(__DIR__ . '/assets/greeting.wav');

        return new CallToolResult(
            content: [
                new TextContent(text: "Synthesized speech for: {$text}"),
                new AudioContent(
                    data: base64_encode($wav),
                    mimeType: 'audio/wav',
                ),
            ]
        );
    }
);

$server->run();
```

### Returning an Embedded Resource

A tool can embed a complete resource -- text or binary -- directly in its result with `EmbeddedResource`. Unlike a loose `TextContent` block, an embedded resource keeps its own URI and MIME type, so the model and client can treat the generated artifact as addressable context:

```php
<?php
// rich_content_embedded.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Types\CallToolResult;
use Mcp\Types\TextContent;
use Mcp\Types\EmbeddedResource;
use Mcp\Types\TextResourceContents;

$server = new McpServer('embedded-tools');

$server->tool(
    'generate-invoice',
    'Generate an invoice and return it as an embedded resource',
    function (string $customer, float $amount): CallToolResult {
        $invoiceId = 'INV-' . str_pad((string) random_int(1, 9999), 4, '0', STR_PAD_LEFT);
        $body = "Invoice {$invoiceId}\nCustomer: {$customer}\nAmount due: \${$amount}\n";

        return new CallToolResult(
            content: [
                new TextContent(text: "Created invoice {$invoiceId} for {$customer}."),
                new EmbeddedResource(
                    resource: new TextResourceContents(
                        text: $body,
                        uri: "invoice://{$invoiceId}",
                        mimeType: 'text/plain',
                    ),
                ),
            ]
        );
    }
);

$server->run();
```

For binary payloads, swap `TextResourceContents` for `BlobResourceContents(blob: base64_encode($bytes), uri: ..., mimeType: ...)`.

## Part 8: Requesting Input with Elicitation

Elicitation lets a tool pause mid-execution and ask the **user** (via the MCP client) for additional information. It turns what would otherwise be a rigid one-shot tool call into an interactive workflow -- the tool can collect missing parameters, confirm a destructive action, or kick off an out-of-band flow like OAuth.

Elicitation was introduced in the MCP `2025-06-18` revision and extended with URL mode in `2025-11-25`. The SDK supports both modes and the same tool code works across the stdio and HTTP transports.

### How Elicitation Works

The SDK automatically injects an `ElicitationContext` into any tool callback that declares one -- no manual wiring is needed, and the context does not appear in the tool's JSON Schema. From there, two different protocol flows are available, depending on which method you call:

**Round-trip flow** (`$elicit->form(...)`, `$elicit->requiresForm(...)`, `$elicit->url(...)`):

1. The MCP client advertises an `elicitation` capability during initialization
2. Your tool calls `form()` or `url()` on the context
3. The SDK sends an `elicitation/create` request to the client
4. The client presents UI to the user and returns the response
5. Your tool receives the result and continues executing in the same tool call

**Error-based flow** (`$elicit->throwUrlRequired(...)`, `$elicit->throwMultipleUrlRequired(...)`):

1. Your tool discovers it is missing an out-of-band prerequisite (credentials, consent, etc.)
2. The tool calls `throwUrlRequired()`, which throws a JSON-RPC `-32042` `URLElicitationRequired` error
3. The current tool call **terminates immediately** -- no result is returned
4. The client presents the URL to the user and opens it in a secure browser context
5. The user completes the out-of-band flow (OAuth, API key entry, payment, etc.) directly with your server's web UI
6. **Later**, the client retries the original tool call from scratch; this time your tool finds the credentials present and proceeds normally

The round-trip flow is appropriate when the client can collect everything inline. The error-based flow is the correct pattern whenever the interaction must not pass through the MCP client -- anything involving credentials, OAuth, or payment.

> **Note:** MCP defines two elicitation modes -- **form** (inline structured data) and **url** (out-of-band flows). This guide covers both. A tool running as a SEP-2663 *task* can also elicit -- the request then surfaces through `tasks/get` and is answered via `tasks/update`, with no change to the tool code. See the [Tasks Extension Guide](tasks.md#in-task-input).

### Form Mode: Collecting Structured Data

Form mode asks the client to collect one or more values from the user and return them inline. The SDK exposes this via `$elicit->form()` and the stricter `$elicit->requiresForm()` helper, which throws an `ElicitationDeclinedException` when the user declines or cancels.

> **Schema restrictions:** form-mode schemas must be a flat object whose properties are primitives (`string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean`), single-select enums, or **multi-select enums expressed as an `array` of enum `items`**. Nested objects and arrays of objects are not supported by design -- the restriction exists so clients can render a simple form UI. See the [spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/client/elicitation) for the full list of supported keywords.

> **Security:** never use form mode to request passwords, API keys, tokens, or payment credentials. Use URL mode for anything sensitive.

#### Simple Form Example

```php
<?php
// elicitation_form_simple.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Server\Elicitation\ElicitationContext;
use Mcp\Server\Elicitation\ElicitationDeclinedException;

$server = new McpServer('elicitation-simple');

$server->tool(
    name: 'send-greeting',
    description: 'Send a personalized greeting, asking the user for their name if needed',
    callback: function (ElicitationContext $elicit, string $name = ''): string {
        // If the model didn't supply a name, ask the user directly.
        if ($name === '') {
            try {
                $result = $elicit->requiresForm(
                    message: 'What name should I use for the greeting?',
                    requestedSchema: [
                        'type' => 'object',
                        'properties' => [
                            'name' => [
                                'type' => 'string',
                                'title' => 'Your name',
                                'minLength' => 1,
                            ],
                        ],
                        'required' => ['name'],
                    ],
                );
                $name = $result->content['name'];
            } catch (ElicitationDeclinedException $e) {
                return 'No greeting sent -- a name is required.';
            }
        }

        return "Hello, {$name}!";
    }
);

$server->run();
```

A few things worth noting:

- `ElicitationContext` can appear anywhere in the parameter list. The SDK strips it before building the tool's input schema, so the model only sees `name`.
- `requiresForm()` returns an `ElicitationCreateResult` on `accept` and throws on `decline` or `cancel`. Use the looser `form()` variant if you want to inspect the action yourself.
- `$result->content` is an associative array whose keys match the `properties` you requested.

#### Multi-Field Form Example

A form can request several primitive fields in a single round-trip. This example confirms a destructive action and collects a reason at the same time:

```php
<?php
// elicitation_form_multi.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Server\Elicitation\ElicitationContext;
use Mcp\Server\Elicitation\ElicitationDeclinedException;

$server = new McpServer('elicitation-multi');

$server->tool(
    name: 'archive-project',
    description: 'Archive a project after confirming with the user',
    callback: function (string $projectId, ElicitationContext $elicit): string {
        try {
            $result = $elicit->requiresForm(
                message: "Archive project '{$projectId}'? This cannot be undone from the client.",
                requestedSchema: [
                    'type' => 'object',
                    'properties' => [
                        'confirm' => [
                            'type' => 'boolean',
                            'title' => 'Confirm archive',
                            'description' => 'Must be checked to proceed',
                            'default' => false,
                        ],
                        'reason' => [
                            'type' => 'string',
                            'title' => 'Reason',
                            'description' => 'Why are you archiving this project?',
                            'minLength' => 3,
                            'maxLength' => 200,
                        ],
                        'visibility' => [
                            'type' => 'string',
                            'title' => 'Post-archive visibility',
                            'enum' => ['hidden', 'read-only', 'public'],
                            'default' => 'hidden',
                        ],
                    ],
                    'required' => ['confirm', 'reason'],
                ],
            );
        } catch (ElicitationDeclinedException $e) {
            return "Archive cancelled ({$e->action}).";
        }

        if (!$result->content['confirm']) {
            return 'Archive cancelled -- confirmation checkbox was not ticked.';
        }

        // In a real server, archive the project here.
        return sprintf(
            "Archived '%s' (visibility: %s). Reason: %s",
            $projectId,
            $result->content['visibility'],
            $result->content['reason'],
        );
    }
);

$server->run();
```

#### Checking Client Capability

Not every MCP client supports elicitation. If your tool can still do useful work without it, use `supportsForm()` to fall back gracefully:

```php
$server->tool(
    name: 'suggest-tag',
    description: 'Suggest a tag for a note, optionally asking the user to pick one',
    callback: function (string $noteText, ElicitationContext $elicit): string {
        $candidates = ['work', 'personal', 'ideas', 'todo'];

        if (!$elicit->supportsForm()) {
            // Client can't elicit -- just return our best guess.
            return "Suggested tag: {$candidates[0]}";
        }

        $result = $elicit->form(
            message: 'Which tag best fits this note?',
            requestedSchema: [
                'type' => 'object',
                'properties' => [
                    'tag' => [
                        'type' => 'string',
                        'title' => 'Tag',
                        'enum' => $candidates,
                    ],
                ],
                'required' => ['tag'],
            ],
        );

        if ($result === null || $result->action !== 'accept') {
            return "Suggested tag: {$candidates[0]}";
        }

        return "You picked: {$result->content['tag']}";
    }
);
```

### URL Mode: Out-of-Band Flows (OAuth, API Keys, Payments)

Form mode is fine for non-sensitive data, but anything involving credentials, OAuth, or payment must go through URL mode -- the MCP client is never allowed to see the user's secrets. In URL mode the server hands the client a URL, the client opens it in a secure browser context, and the user interacts with the server's own web UI directly.

The recommended pattern is the **error-based flow**: when your tool discovers it is missing an out-of-band prerequisite, call `$elicit->throwUrlRequired()`. This throws a JSON-RPC `-32042` error that tells the client "retry this tool call once the user has completed the URL interaction."

```php
<?php
// elicitation_url_oauth.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Server\Elicitation\ElicitationContext;

$server = new McpServer('elicitation-oauth');

// Replace this with your real token store (bound to the authenticated MCP user).
function lookup_github_token(): ?string
{
    return $_SESSION['github_token'] ?? null;
}

$server->tool(
    name: 'list-my-repos',
    description: 'List the authenticated user\'s GitHub repositories',
    callback: function (ElicitationContext $elicit, int $limit = 10): string {
        $token = lookup_github_token();

        if ($token === null) {
            // No credentials yet -- ask the client to open our connect URL.
            // The client retries this tool call once the user finishes the flow.
            $elicit->throwUrlRequired(
                message: 'Connect your GitHub account to list repositories.',
                url: 'https://myserver.example.com/oauth/github/start?state=' . bin2hex(random_bytes(8)),
            );
        }

        // If we reach here, the retry succeeded -- do the real work.
        $repos = ['alpha', 'beta', 'gamma']; // real call would use $token
        return "Your repos:\n- " . implode("\n- ", array_slice($repos, 0, $limit));
    }
);

$server->run();
```

Key points about URL mode:

- `throwUrlRequired()` never returns -- it always throws. Treat it as a terminator.
- The URL you provide must be a page **on your own server** (or a trusted provider). Your server is responsible for authenticating the visiting user before redirecting them to any third-party authorization endpoint -- see the [MCP security guidance](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/client/elicitation) for details.
- Credentials obtained through the URL flow must be stored server-side, bound to the authenticated MCP user identity, and never sent back to the client.
- If a single call needs multiple out-of-band interactions, use `throwMultipleUrlRequired()` with an array of `['message' => ..., 'url' => ...]` entries.

#### Notifying the Client When the Flow Completes

Clients may choose to wait for a `notifications/elicitation/complete` notification before retrying the tool call. This notification is a **hint**, not a requirement -- clients are always expected to provide a manual retry path, so sending it is optional and your tool will still work without it.

The notification can only be sent through a live, connected MCP session (the transport must have an open channel back to the client). In practice that means you can reliably send it from **inside a running tool callback**, where an `ElicitationContext` is already in scope:

```php
// Inside a tool callback that has observed completion of its own out-of-band flow:
$elicit->notifyUrlComplete($elicitationId);
```

This is useful for tools that can check their own completion state -- for example, a tool that stores a "pending credential" row when it throws the URL error, and on its next invocation notices the row has been filled in.

> **Heads up (stateless HTTP hosting):** on typical cPanel-style PHP hosting the OAuth redirect handler runs in a **completely separate HTTP request** from the MCP endpoint. That handler has no live MCP session to write to, so it cannot send this notification directly -- doing so would require additional infrastructure (an SSE connection registry, a shared pub/sub queue, etc.) that is outside the scope of the convenience wrapper. That's fine: the client will let the user retry manually, and the retried tool call can detect the now-present credentials and complete normally. For long-running stdio servers the same process holds the session, so in-tool notifications from background work are trivial.

### Elicitation Across Transports and Eras

Your tool code is identical everywhere -- write it as straight-line,
synchronous code. Under the hood the SDK picks the mechanics per
transport and per negotiated era:

- **Stdio:** the call to `form()` blocks until the client responds, then returns normally.
- **HTTP, modern era (`2026-07-28`):** the spec replaces server-initiated
  requests with **multi-round-trip input** (SEP-2322): the tool call
  answers with an `input_required` result carrying the elicitation
  request and a signed, tamper-proof `requestState`; the client collects
  the input and retries the call with the answers attached; the SDK
  re-executes your callback with each completed `form()` / `url()` call
  returning its previously-collected result instead of firing a new
  request. Several pending inputs can be batched into a single round.
- **HTTP, legacy era (legacy only):** the SDK **suspends** the
  in-progress tool call server-side, returns the elicitation request, and
  transparently **resumes** the callback on the next HTTP round-trip --
  same re-entry behavior, session-backed instead of state-token-backed.

In both HTTP models your callback is re-entered from the top, so one rule
applies: **elicitation calls must happen in a deterministic order**.
Don't make an elicitation call conditional on data that changes between
rounds (e.g. `rand()`, the current timestamp, or external state that may
have shifted), or the SDK won't be able to match the stored results back
to the calls. When the same logical question might be re-asked on a
retried request, pass the optional `inputKey:` argument to `form()` to
give the round a stable name.

No extra wiring is required in your server file -- `McpServer::run()` /
`runHttp()` handle all of it automatically.

The same machinery also powers server-initiated LLM sampling (covered in
[Part 9](#part-9-server-initiated-llm-sampling)), and a single tool call
can freely mix `$elicit->form()` and `$sampling->prompt()` calls -- the
SDK carries the collected results of **both** features forward across
every round. To gather several inputs of *mixed* kinds in one round trip
on the modern era, type-hint `Mcp\Server\InputRequired\InputContext` and
batch them (`wantForm()` / `wantSample()` / `wantRoots()`, then
`collect()`); see [`examples/elicitation_server.php`](../examples/elicitation_server.php)
for the plain path.

One modern-era behavior worth knowing: a `2026-07-28` request whose
capability envelope did not declare `elicitation` makes `form()` fail the
call with `-32021` (`MissingRequiredClientCapability`) instead of
silently returning `null` (legacy behavior). Check `supportsForm()` first
-- as in the example above -- when the tool can degrade gracefully.

One legacy-era limit: prompt callbacks (`prompts/get`) can only gather
input on the modern era -- a legacy HTTP `prompts/get` whose callback
declares an `ElicitationContext` fails with `-32603` (the legacy
suspend/resume store is tools-only). Tool callbacks are unaffected.

---

## Part 9: Server-Initiated LLM Sampling

Sampling lets a tool ask the **client's LLM** to generate a completion on the server's behalf. It is the agentic mirror of elicitation: elicitation asks a human for input, sampling asks a language model for a response. The server never has to ship its own model or manage inference -- the client routes the request to whatever LLM the user already has configured (Claude Desktop, an IDE assistant, a local model, etc.), so cost, policy, and privacy all stay on the client side.

The core `sampling/createMessage` primitive has been part of MCP since the base `2024-11-05` revision, so a plain `$sampling->prompt(...)` works against any client that negotiates `2024-11-05` or newer. What is newer is the **SDK support** for it: server-initiated sampling now works across both stdio and HTTP using the same suspend/resume plumbing that powers elicitation, and the `2025-11-25` revision also adds **tool-enabled sampling** (passing `tools` and `toolChoice` to `createMessage()` so the client's LLM can emit tool-use blocks), which the SDK gates on the client's `sampling.tools` sub-capability.

### How Sampling Works

The SDK injects a `SamplingContext` into any tool callback that declares one, using the same reflection mechanism as `ElicitationContext`. From there, your tool calls `prompt()` or `createMessage()` on the context and gets a `CreateMessageResult` back -- or `null` if the client didn't advertise the `sampling` capability.

1. The MCP client advertises a `sampling` capability during initialization
2. Your tool calls `$sampling->prompt(...)` or `$sampling->createMessage(...)`
3. The SDK sends a `sampling/createMessage` request to the client
4. The client runs its LLM (with optional user review) and returns the completion
5. Your tool receives a `CreateMessageResult` and continues

Per the MCP spec, `sampling/createMessage` may only be sent while the server is processing a client-originated request -- there's no "background sampling." The SDK enforces this structurally: `SamplingContext` is only ever instantiated inside a tool handler, so there is no way to accidentally sample outside that window.

### When to Use It

- **Agentic tools** that need a follow-up completion to analyze, summarize, or rephrase something the tool just computed.
- **Content generation** inside a tool where you want the user's own LLM (and their API key / model choice) to produce the text rather than the server shipping its own inference.
- **Multi-step reasoning** where the server has domain knowledge but wants the client's LLM to stitch the final answer together.
- **Keeping policy on the client.** Content filtering, audit logging, and rate limiting happen where the user has already set them up.

### Basic Sampling Example

A tool that forwards a user-supplied prompt to the client's LLM and returns the completion:

```php
<?php
// sampling_basic.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Server\Sampling\SamplingContext;
use Mcp\Types\TextContent;

$server = new McpServer('sampling-basic');

$server->tool(
    name: 'summarize',
    description: 'Ask the client LLM to summarize a block of text in one sentence',
    callback: function (string $text, SamplingContext $sampling): string {
        if (!$sampling->supportsSampling()) {
            return 'This client does not support sampling -- cannot summarize.';
        }

        $result = $sampling->prompt(
            text: "Summarize the following in one sentence:\n\n{$text}",
            maxTokens: 200,
        );

        if ($result === null) {
            return 'Summarization is unavailable right now.';
        }

        // A plain prompt() returns a single text content block.
        if ($result->content instanceof TextContent) {
            return $result->content->text;
        }

        return 'Received an unexpected content type from the LLM.';
    }
);

$server->run();
```

Notes:

- `SamplingContext` can appear anywhere in the parameter list; the SDK strips it from the tool's input schema so the model only sees `text`.
- `prompt()` is a one-shot convenience for single-turn text. It returns `null` when the client has not advertised `sampling`, when the negotiated protocol version is too old, or when the client returns an error -- always check.
- `CreateMessageResult::$content` is a `TextContent|ImageContent|AudioContent|ToolUseContent` or an array of those, so handle it with `instanceof` rather than assuming a shape.

### Structured Sampling Example

`createMessage()` is the full API: multi-turn transcripts, an optional system prompt, temperature control, and `ModelPreferences` that let the server hint (but not require) properties like cost, speed, or intelligence bias. Here is a tool that asks the client LLM to classify a support ticket against a fixed taxonomy:

```php
<?php
// sampling_classify.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Server\Sampling\SamplingContext;
use Mcp\Types\ModelPreferences;
use Mcp\Types\Role;
use Mcp\Types\SamplingMessage;
use Mcp\Types\TextContent;

$server = new McpServer('sampling-classify');

$server->tool(
    name: 'classify-ticket',
    description: 'Classify a support ticket as billing, technical, or account',
    callback: function (string $ticket, SamplingContext $sampling): string {
        $messages = [
            new SamplingMessage(
                role: Role::USER,
                content: new TextContent(text: "Ticket:\n{$ticket}\n\nCategory?"),
            ),
        ];

        $result = $sampling->createMessage(
            messages: $messages,
            maxTokens: 10,
            systemPrompt: 'Reply with exactly one word: billing, technical, or account.',
            temperature: 0.0,
            // Hint: cheaper + faster is fine, we don't need a flagship model for a one-word label.
            modelPreferences: new ModelPreferences(
                costPriority: 0.8,
                speedPriority: 0.8,
                intelligencePriority: 0.2,
            ),
        );

        if ($result === null || !($result->content instanceof TextContent)) {
            return 'unclassified';
        }

        $label = strtolower(trim($result->content->text));
        return in_array($label, ['billing', 'technical', 'account'], true)
            ? $label
            : 'unclassified';
    }
);

$server->run();
```

`ModelPreferences` is advisory -- the client decides whether to honor the hints. Always validate the response against what you actually need (here: coerce to the taxonomy, fall back to `unclassified`) rather than trusting the LLM to comply with the system prompt exactly.

### Combining Sampling and Elicitation

Sampling and elicitation compose. A tool can ask the user for a topic, then ask the client's LLM to draft something based on it, all in a single tool call:

```php
<?php
// sampling_plus_elicitation.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Server\Elicitation\ElicitationContext;
use Mcp\Server\Elicitation\ElicitationDeclinedException;
use Mcp\Server\Sampling\SamplingContext;
use Mcp\Types\TextContent;

$server = new McpServer('draft-helper');

$server->tool(
    name: 'draft-tweet',
    description: 'Ask the user for a topic, then draft a tweet about it using the client LLM',
    callback: function (ElicitationContext $elicit, SamplingContext $sampling): string {
        try {
            $form = $elicit->requiresForm(
                message: 'What should the tweet be about?',
                requestedSchema: [
                    'type' => 'object',
                    'properties' => [
                        'topic' => ['type' => 'string', 'title' => 'Topic', 'minLength' => 2],
                        'tone'  => [
                            'type' => 'string',
                            'title' => 'Tone',
                            'enum' => ['serious', 'playful', 'technical'],
                            'default' => 'playful',
                        ],
                    ],
                    'required' => ['topic'],
                ],
            );
        } catch (ElicitationDeclinedException $e) {
            return 'No topic provided -- nothing to draft.';
        }

        $topic = $form->content['topic'];
        $tone = $form->content['tone'] ?? 'playful';

        $draft = $sampling->prompt(
            text: "Write a single tweet (under 280 chars) about {$topic}. Tone: {$tone}.",
            maxTokens: 120,
        );

        if ($draft === null || !($draft->content instanceof TextContent)) {
            return "Drafting failed, but here's the topic you picked: {$topic} ({$tone}).";
        }

        return $draft->content->text;
    }
);

$server->run();
```

Under HTTP this tool suspends twice -- once on the form, once on the sampling request -- so the callback ends up being invoked three times total: the initial invocation plus two resumes. On each resume the SDK re-enters the callback from the top, and every completed `form()` / `prompt()` call returns its stored result instead of firing a new request. You never have to think about that -- just write straight-line code and keep the call order deterministic so the stored results match up on every re-entry.

### Sampling Across Transports and Eras

Sampling works identically across stdio and HTTP, with the same
per-era mechanics as elicitation ([Part 8](#elicitation-across-transports-and-eras)):

- **Stdio:** the call to `prompt()` / `createMessage()` blocks until the client returns the completion.
- **HTTP, modern era:** the sampling request rides an `input_required`
  (SEP-2322) exchange -- the client's LLM answers on the retried round and
  the SDK re-executes the tool with the preloaded result.
- **HTTP, legacy era (legacy only):** the SDK suspends the tool, emits the `sampling/createMessage` request to the client, and transparently resumes the tool on the next HTTP round with the preloaded result.

The deterministic-ordering rule from [Part 8](#elicitation-across-transports-and-eras) applies to sampling as well: don't make a sampling call conditional on non-deterministic data between rounds, or the SDK won't be able to match the stored result back to the call.

### Feature Gating

Two capability checks to know about:

- `$sampling->supportsSampling()` -- returns `true` when the client advertised `sampling` during initialization and the negotiated protocol version covers it. Call this early and short-circuit if the answer is `false`.
- `$sampling->supportsToolsInSampling()` -- tool-enabled sampling (passing `tools` / `toolChoice` to `createMessage()`) is gated on the `sampling.tools` sub-capability introduced in `2025-11-25`. If you plan to pass tools, check this separately; otherwise omit the check.

If the client doesn't support sampling, `prompt()` and `createMessage()` both return `null` without sending any request. Handle `null` the same way you would handle any optional feature -- fall back, return a useful message, or mark the tool result as an error.

## Part 10: Providing Completions

When a server advertises `completions`, clients can ask it to suggest values for a prompt argument or a resource-template variable as the user types -- the same way an IDE autocompletes. You register a provider per (prompt-or-template, argument) pair, and the SDK advertises the `completions` capability automatically as soon as the first provider is registered. Nothing else to wire up.

### Completing a Prompt Argument

Use `completionForPrompt(promptName, argumentName, provider)`. The provider receives the partial value the user has typed so far and returns an array of candidate strings:

```php
<?php
// completion_prompt.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;

$server = new McpServer('completion-server');

$server->prompt(
    'review-code',
    'Review a snippet in a given language',
    function (string $language, string $code): string {
        return "Review this {$language} code:\n\n{$code}";
    }
);

// Suggest values for the prompt's "language" argument. $value is what the
// user has typed so far; return the candidates that match.
$server->completionForPrompt(
    'review-code',
    'language',
    function (string $value): array {
        $languages = ['php', 'python', 'javascript', 'rust', 'go'];
        return array_values(array_filter(
            $languages,
            fn (string $lang): bool => str_starts_with($lang, strtolower($value)),
        ));
    }
);

$server->run();
```

### Completing a Resource-Template Variable

Use `completionForResourceTemplate(uriTemplate, variableName, provider)`. The template string must **exactly match** one you registered with `resourceTemplate()` (see [Part 3](#resource-templates)):

```php
<?php
// completion_template.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;

$server = new McpServer('completion-template-server');

$server->resourceTemplate(
    uriTemplate: 'users://{userId}/profile',
    name: 'User Profile',
    callback: fn (string $userId): string => "Profile for {$userId}",
    mimeType: 'application/json',
);

// Suggest values for the {userId} variable. The first argument must be the
// exact template string registered above.
$server->completionForResourceTemplate(
    'users://{userId}/profile',
    'userId',
    function (string $value): array {
        $ids = ['1001', '1002', '2001'];
        return array_values(array_filter(
            $ids,
            fn (string $id): bool => str_starts_with($id, $value),
        ));
    }
);

$server->run();
```

### Context-Aware Completions

A provider may accept a second `array $context` parameter holding the values the user has already chosen for *other* arguments of the same prompt. Use it to narrow later suggestions -- for example, only offering frameworks that match the language already picked:

```php
$server->completionForPrompt(
    'scaffold',
    'framework',
    function (string $value, array $context): array {
        $byLanguage = [
            'php'    => ['laravel', 'symfony', 'slim'],
            'python' => ['django', 'flask', 'fastapi'],
        ];
        $candidates = $byLanguage[$context['language'] ?? ''] ?? [];
        return array_values(array_filter(
            $candidates,
            fn (string $f): bool => str_starts_with($f, $value),
        ));
    }
);
```

The SDK wraps your array in the protocol's completion response and caps it at 100 suggestions, setting the `hasMore` flag when it truncates. If you need full control over the `total` and `hasMore` fields, return a `Mcp\Types\CompletionObject` (or a complete `Mcp\Types\CompleteResult`) instead of a plain array.

## Part 11: Emitting Notifications, Logging, and Progress

Every example so far has returned a single result. MCP also lets a server push *out-of-band* messages to the client while it works: progress updates during a long tool call, log messages, and "the list changed" hints that tell the client to refetch its tool/prompt/resource catalog. These are one-way notifications -- the server emits them, and the client's notification handler receives them (the [client guide](client-dev.md#part-9-notifications-progress-and-logging) covers the receiving side).

> **Transport note (required reading for HTTP):** Server-to-client notifications travel on the open channel back to the client, and the two transports differ in a way that matters for compliance:
>
> - **Over stdio** the channel is always present -- emit freely.
> - **Over HTTP** the Streamable HTTP spec requires that a plain `application/json` POST response contain exactly **one** JSON object: the result of the request. Notifications can only be delivered on a `text/event-stream` (SSE) response, interleaved *before* that result. So to emit notifications over HTTP you **must** enable SSE with `->httpOptions(['enable_sse' => true])`. With SSE left at its default (`false`), there is no spec-compliant way to attach a notification to the response, so a server that emits notifications must run over stdio or over an SSE-enabled HTTP endpoint. Every example in this section enables SSE for that reason. This applies to both protocol eras -- on the modern (`2026-07-28`) era the SSE response is *request-scoped* (notifications first, then the final response ends the stream), and notifications preceding an error response are dropped (error statuses cannot ride a committed stream).
>
> One more HTTP caveat even with SSE on: a stateless shared-hosting request that has already returned cannot push a notification after the fact. Always emit from *inside* a tool callback, while the request is still being processed. For change notifications that must reach clients *between* requests on the modern era, use [`subscriptions/listen`](#publishing-change-notifications-subscriptionslisten) below.

### Reporting Progress from a Long Tool

A tool callback can type-hint `ProgressContext` to report incremental progress. The SDK injects it **only** when the client attached a `progressToken` to the call, so make the parameter nullable with a default of `null` and guard on it with `?->`:

```php
<?php
// emit_progress.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Shared\ProgressContext;

$server = new McpServer('progress-server');

// Required for HTTP: progress notifications can only be delivered on an SSE
// response. Without this, an HTTP server has no compliant way to emit them.
// (No effect over stdio.) See the transport note above.
$server->httpOptions(['enable_sse' => true]);

$server->tool(
    'process-batch',
    'Process a batch of records, reporting progress as it goes',
    function (int $count, ?ProgressContext $progress = null): string {
        for ($i = 0; $i < $count; $i++) {
            // ... do one unit of work ...

            // Report one step. If the client didn't request progress,
            // $progress is null and this line is a no-op.
            $progress?->progress(1);
        }

        return "Processed {$count} records.";
    }
);

$server->run();
```

`ProgressContext::progress($amount)` increments a running total and emits a `notifications/progress`, which is all most tools need. The `ProgressContext` parameter is stripped from the tool's input schema, so the model never sees it.

If you want to send an explicit `total` so the client can render a percentage, reach the live session and call `sendProgressNotification()` with the token directly:

```php
$server->tool(
    'export-data',
    'Export records, reporting percent complete',
    function (?ProgressContext $progress = null) use ($server): string {
        $session = $server->getServer()->getSession();
        $token   = $progress?->getToken();

        if ($session !== null && $token !== null) {
            $session->sendProgressNotification($token, 0, 100);
            // ... first half of the work ...
            $session->sendProgressNotification($token, 50, 100);
            // ... second half of the work ...
            $session->sendProgressNotification($token, 100, 100);
        }

        return 'Export complete.';
    }
);
```

### Sending Log Messages

A server can stream structured log messages to the client at the standard syslog severities (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `NOTICE`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`, `ALERT`, `EMERGENCY`). To advertise the `logging` capability -- which is what tells a spec-compliant client it may set a minimum level and expect log notifications -- register a `logging/setLevel` handler on the underlying `Server`. Then call `sendLogMessage()` from inside your tool:

```php
<?php
// emit_logging.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Types\LoggingLevel;
use Mcp\Types\EmptyResult;

$server = new McpServer('logging-server');

// Required for HTTP: log notifications ride an SSE response (see transport note).
$server->httpOptions(['enable_sse' => true]);

// Advertise the `logging` capability. McpServer has no high-level wrapper for
// logging/setLevel, so register it on the low-level Server. Accepting the level
// is enough here; a real server could store it and filter its own output.
$server->getServer()->registerHandler('logging/setLevel', fn () => new EmptyResult());

$server->tool(
    'reindex',
    'Rebuild the search index, logging progress to the client',
    function () use ($server): string {
        $session = $server->getServer()->getSession();

        if ($session !== null) {
            // level, data (any JSON-serializable value), and an optional logger name.
            $session->sendLogMessage(LoggingLevel::INFO, 'Reindex started', 'search');
            // ... work ...
            $session->sendLogMessage(LoggingLevel::INFO, 'Reindex finished', 'search');
        }

        return 'Reindex complete.';
    }
);

$server->run();
```

The `data` argument can be any JSON-serializable value -- a string, or a structured array like `['stage' => 'merge', 'docs' => 1200]` -- and the optional third argument is a logger name the client can display or filter on.

> **Deprecation note (SEP-2577):** the `2026-07-28` spec deprecates the
> Logging feature (migration path: log to stderr for stdio transports;
> use OpenTelemetry for observability), and the stateless revision
> removes `logging/setLevel` from the modern path (a `2026-07-28` client

> [Deprecated Protocol Features](#deprecated-protocol-features).

### Publishing Change Notifications (`subscriptions/listen`)

On the modern (`2026-07-28`) era there are no server-initiated
notifications outside a request -- the standing channel is
**`subscriptions/listen`** (SEP-2575): a client opens one long-lived
request naming the change events it wants (`toolsListChanged`,
`promptsListChanged`, `resourcesListChanged`, and per-resource
`resourceSubscriptions`, which replaces the removed `resources/subscribe`
RPC), the server acknowledges, and matching events stream until either
side ends the subscription.

The SDK implements the whole channel; your server's job is two calls --
configure an event bus, and publish when something changes:

```php
<?php
// listen_server.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;
use Mcp\Server\Subscriptions\FileSubscriptionBus;

$server = new McpServer('dynamic-server');

// The bus carries events across PHP processes (shared hosting: the process
// serving the listen stream is not the one whose tool changed the catalog).
// Use InMemorySubscriptionBus for single-process runtimes and tests.
$server->subscriptionBus(new FileSubscriptionBus(__DIR__ . '/mcp_events'));

$server->tool('enable-beta-tools', 'Turn on the beta tool set', function () use ($server): string {
    // ... change the catalog, then publish:
    $server->publishToolsListChanged();
    return 'Beta tools enabled.';
});

$server->run();
```

The publish helpers are `publishToolsListChanged()`,
`publishPromptsListChanged()`, `publishResourcesListChanged()`, and
`publishResourceUpdated(string $uri)`. They can be called from anywhere
that can construct the bus -- including a cron job or queue worker
outside the MCP request cycle entirely.

Wire details the SDK handles: the acknowledgement is always the stream's
first message, every frame carries the
`io.modelcontextprotocol/subscriptionId` `_meta` key, only opted-in event
types are delivered (strict filter containment), a server-initiated
graceful end sends a closing `SubscriptionsListenResult`, and a server
that cannot deliver events (no bus configured on HTTP) answers `-32601`
rather than acknowledging a subscription it would silently drop. On
stdio, subscriptions live in-session and need no bus. Long-lived HTTP
streams are subject to host timeouts on shared hosting -- clients are
expected to reconnect; see [docs/compatibility.md](compatibility.md).

### Signaling That a List Changed (legacy sessions)

For **legacy-era** clients (`2024-11-05` … `2025-11-25`), list-change
signaling instead uses the classic capability + notification pair. If
your server adds or removes tools, prompts, or resources at runtime, tell
the client its cached catalog is stale so it refetches. This is a
two-step feature:

1. **Advertise the capability** with `notifyOnChanges()` before `run()`. This sets the `listChanged` flags in the initialization handshake so the client knows to listen.
2. **Emit the notification** when the list actually changes, via `sendToolListChanged()`, `sendResourceListChanged()`, or `sendPromptListChanged()` on the session.

```php
<?php
// emit_list_changed.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;

$server = new McpServer('dynamic-server');

// Required for HTTP: list-changed notifications ride an SSE response (see transport note).
$server->httpOptions(['enable_sse' => true]);

// Step 1: advertise that this server may send list-changed notifications.
$server->notifyOnChanges(
    resourcesChanged: true,
    toolsChanged: true,
    promptsChanged: true,
);

// Step 2: each tool calls the matching send…ListChanged() method after it
// changes the corresponding catalog. The three methods are independent --
// emit only the one(s) whose list actually changed.

$server->tool('enable-beta-tools', 'Turn on the beta tool set', function () use ($server): string {
    // ... register or unregister tools based on application state ...

    // The TOOL list changed -> notify so the client refetches tools/list.
    $session = $server->getServer()->getSession();
    $session?->sendToolListChanged();

    return 'Beta tools enabled.';
});

$server->tool('mount-dataset', 'Expose a new dataset as readable resources', function () use ($server): string {
    // ... add resources for the newly mounted dataset ...

    // The RESOURCE list changed -> notify so the client refetches resources/list.
    $session = $server->getServer()->getSession();
    $session?->sendResourceListChanged();

    return 'Dataset mounted.';
});

$server->tool('install-prompt-pack', 'Add a pack of prompt templates', function () use ($server): string {
    // ... register the new prompts ...

    // The PROMPT list changed -> notify so the client refetches prompts/list.
    $session = $server->getServer()->getSession();
    $session?->sendPromptListChanged();

    return 'Prompt pack installed.';
});

$server->run();
```

`notifyOnChanges()` only advertises the capability -- it does **not** auto-emit when you register a tool, prompt, or resource. You decide when a list has meaningfully changed and call the matching method: `sendToolListChanged()`, `sendResourceListChanged()`, or `sendPromptListChanged()`. The three are independent, so emit only the one whose catalog actually changed. As with all server notifications, delivery is immediate over stdio and, over HTTP, rides the in-flight request's SSE response (hence the `enable_sse => true` above). A long-running stdio server is the natural home for catalogs that change between calls.

## Part 12: Multi-Capability Servers

Real-world MCP servers combine tools, prompts, and resources. Here is a complete server that demonstrates all three working together:

```php
<?php
// multi_capability.php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Mcp\Server\McpServer;

$server = new McpServer('project-assistant');

// --- Tools ---

$server
    ->tool(
        'estimate-reading-time',
        'Estimate reading time for a given text',
        function (string $text, int $wpm = 200): string {
            $wordCount = str_word_count($text);
            $minutes = ceil($wordCount / $wpm);
            return "{$wordCount} words, approximately {$minutes} minute(s) to read at {$wpm} WPM.";
        }
    )
    ->tool(
        'generate-table-of-contents',
        'Extract markdown headings to build a table of contents',
        function (string $markdown): string {
            preg_match_all('/^(#{1,6})\s+(.+)$/m', $markdown, $matches, PREG_SET_ORDER);

            if (empty($matches)) {
                return 'No headings found in the provided markdown.';
            }

            $toc = "## Table of Contents\n\n";
            foreach ($matches as $match) {
                $level = strlen($match[1]);
                $title = trim($match[2]);
                $slug = strtolower(preg_replace('/[^a-z0-9]+/', '-', $title));
                $indent = str_repeat('  ', $level - 1);
                $toc .= "{$indent}- [{$title}](#{$slug})\n";
            }

            return $toc;
        }
    );

// --- Prompts ---

$server
    ->prompt(
        'write-readme',
        'Generate a README.md for a project',
        function (string $project_name, string $description, string $language = 'PHP'): string {
            return <<<PROMPT
            Write a professional README.md for a project with these details:

            - **Project Name**: {$project_name}
            - **Description**: {$description}
            - **Language**: {$language}

            Include these sections: Overview, Features, Installation, Usage, Configuration, Contributing, and License (MIT).
            Use proper markdown formatting with code examples.
            PROMPT;
        }
    )
    ->prompt(
        'document-function',
        'Generate documentation for a function or method',
        function (string $function_signature, string $purpose): string {
            return <<<PROMPT
            Write comprehensive documentation for this function:

            ```
            {$function_signature}
            ```

            Purpose: {$purpose}

            Include: description, parameter documentation, return value, usage example, and edge cases.
            PROMPT;
        }
    );

// --- Resources ---

$server
    ->resource(
        uri: 'guide://coding-standards',
        name: 'Coding Standards',
        description: 'Team coding standards and conventions',
        callback: function (): string {
            return <<<'STANDARDS'
            # Coding Standards

            ## PHP
            - Follow PSR-12 coding style
            - Use strict_types=1 in all files
            - Type-hint all parameters and return types
            - Use named arguments for constructors with 3+ parameters

            ## Naming
            - Classes: PascalCase
            - Methods/Functions: camelCase
            - Variables: camelCase
            - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
            - Database tables: snake_case (plural)

            ## Git
            - Branch naming: feature/description, fix/description, chore/description
            - Commit messages: imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
            - Squash merge feature branches
            STANDARDS;
        },
        mimeType: 'text/markdown'
    )
    ->resource(
        uri: 'guide://project-structure',

## Deprecated Protocol Features

The `2026-07-28` spec deprecates several protocol features (SEP-2596 /
SEP-2577). **Nothing stops working** -- there is no wire-level deprecation
signal, and deprecated features keep functioning through the spec's
minimum twelve-month window. The SDK mirrors the spec's registry as
`Mcp\Shared\FeatureLifecycle`, marks the affected classes and APIs with
`@deprecated` docblocks, and emits **one PSR-3 warning per feature per
session** (through the logger you supply; the default `NullLogger`
discards them) when a deprecated feature is exercised on a session whose
negotiated revision deprecates it.

Server-relevant entries: **Sampling** and **Logging** (both deprecated at
`2026-07-28` -- see the notes in [Part 9](#part-9-server-initiated-llm-sampling)
and [Part 11](#part-11-emitting-notifications-logging-and-progress)) and
the `includeContext: "thisServer"|"allServers"` sampling values
(deprecated at `2025-11-25` -- omit the field or use `"none"`). The full
registry, including the client-side entries, is in the
[Migration Guide](migration-v2.md#11-deprecated-mcp-features-and-runtime-warnings-m8).

## Appendix A: Configuration Reference

### HTTP Transport Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `session_timeout` | int | 3600 | Session expiry in seconds (**legacy only** -- modern requests are sessionless) |
| `max_queue_size` | int | 1000 | Maximum messages in queue per session |
| `enable_sse` | bool | false | Master switch for Server-Sent Events. While `false` every POST gets a plain JSON response. Set to `true` to let the transport negotiate SSE via the client's `Accept` header |
| `sse_mode` | string | `'auto'` | Secondary setting that applies only when `enable_sse` is `true` and the transport picks SSE for a request. `'auto'` (stream only when the request carries a `progressToken`), `'streaming'` (always stream when the runtime permits), or `'buffered'` (single-response SSE -- never mid-response flushing) |
| `sse_retry_ms` | int | 1500 | Reconnect hint emitted on SSE streams via the WHATWG `retry` field |
| `sse_event_log_capacity` | int | 64 | Max events retained per session for resumable replay via `Last-Event-ID` (**legacy only** -- no resumption exists on the modern path) |
| `sse_standalone_get_idle_ms` | int | 0 | How long an idle standalone-GET SSE stream stays open; default 0 closes immediately (correct for PHP-FPM, where no background worker exists to push messages) (**legacy only**) |
| `subscription_bus` | SubscriptionBusInterface/null | null | Event bus backing `subscriptions/listen` on HTTP; normally set via `subscriptionBus()` (see [Part 11](#publishing-change-notifications-subscriptionslisten)) |
| `shared_hosting` | bool/null | null (auto-detect) | Force shared hosting optimizations |
| `server_header` | string | `MCP-PHP-Server/1.0` | Server identification header |
| `allowed_origins` | array/null | null | Allowed hostnames for Origin validation (auto-set for `cli-server` SAPI) |
| `auth_enabled` | bool | false | Enable OAuth token validation |
| `authorization_servers` | array | [] | Authorization server URLs |
| `resource` | string/null | null | Protected resource identifier |
| `token_validator` | TokenValidatorInterface/null | null | Token validator instance |
| `resource_metadata_path` | string | `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` | OAuth metadata endpoint |

### JwtTokenValidator Constructor

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `$key` | string | Shared secret (HS256) or PEM public key (RS256) |
| `$algorithm` | string | `'HS256'` or `'RS256'` (default: `'HS256'`) |
| `$issuer` | string/null | Expected `iss` claim value |
| `$audience` | string/null | Expected `aud` claim value |
| `$jwksUri` | string/null | JWKS endpoint URL for RS256 key fetching |

### McpServer Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `tool(name, description, callback, title?, icons?, outputSchema?, inputSchema?, taskSupport?, annotations?)` | Register a tool; `taskSupport` (a `TaskSupport` constant) opts it into SEP-2663 task augmentation -- see the [Tasks guide](tasks.md); `annotations` sets spec `ToolAnnotations` behavioral hints (array or `ToolAnnotations`) -- see [Tool Annotations](#tool-annotations) |
| `prompt(name, description, callback, title?, icons?)` | Register a prompt |
| `resource(uri, name, callback, description?, mimeType?, title?, icons?, size?)` | Register a resource |
| `resourceTemplate(uriTemplate, name, callback, description?, mimeType?, title?, icons?)` | Register a resource template (variables passed to the callback by name) |
| `ui(tool, uri, name, html, description?, visibility?, csp?, permissions?, domain?, prefersBorder?)` | Attach an MCP Apps (SEP-1865) UI template to a registered tool |
| `completionForPrompt(promptName, argumentName, provider)` | Register an argument-completion provider for a prompt |
| `completionForResourceTemplate(uriTemplate, variableName, provider)` | Register a completion provider for a resource-template variable |
| `httpOptions(array)` | Set HTTP transport configuration |
| `sessionStore(SessionStoreInterface)` | Set the session persistence backend |
| `withAuth(tokenValidator, authorizationServers, resourceId)` | Enable OAuth authentication |
| `notifyOnChanges(resourcesChanged?, toolsChanged?, promptsChanged?)` | Configure legacy list-changed notifications (**legacy only**; modern clients use `subscriptions/listen`) |
| `enableTasks(storagePath?, defaultTtlMs?, defaultPollIntervalMs?)` | Enable the SEP-2663 Tasks extension: declares it and registers `tasks/get`/`tasks/update`/`tasks/cancel` -- see the [Tasks guide](tasks.md) |
| `subscriptionBus(SubscriptionBusInterface)` | Configure the event bus backing `subscriptions/listen` on HTTP |
| `publishToolsListChanged()` / `publishPromptsListChanged()` / `publishResourcesListChanged()` / `publishResourceUpdated(uri)` | Publish a change event to active `subscriptions/listen` subscribers |
| `run()` | Auto-detect transport and start |
| `runStdio()` | Force stdio transport |
| `runHttp()` | Force HTTP transport |
| *Context injection* | A tool callback that type-hints `ElicitationContext`, `SamplingContext`, `InputContext`, `ProgressContext`, or `TaskContext` automatically receives that context at call time. The parameter is stripped from the tool's input schema. |
| `getServer()` | Access the underlying Server instance |
| `getTaskManager()` | Access the TaskManager instance (application-driven async tasks -- see the [Tasks guide](tasks.md)) |
| `TaskContext::defer(statusMessage?)` | From inside a task-augmented tool: hand the work to an out-of-band worker and leave the task `working`; the worker settles it via `getTaskManager()` -- see [Deferring to a background worker](tasks.md#deferring-to-a-background-worker) |

### Callback Return Types

| Primitive | Return Type | SDK Behavior |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Tool** | `string` | Wrapped in `TextContent` inside `CallToolResult` |
| **Tool** | `CallToolResult` | Returned as-is |
| **Tool** | any JSON value (with `outputSchema`) | Wrapped with `content` (JSON-encoded text) + `structuredContent` -- with an `outputSchema` declared, the return value **is** the structured output, so a returned string arrives JSON-encoded (`"hello"` with quotes) |
| **Prompt** | `string` | Wrapped as single user-role `PromptMessage` |
| **Prompt** | `array` of strings | Each string becomes a user-role `PromptMessage` |
| **Prompt** | `GetPromptResult` | Returned as-is |
| **Resource** | `string` | Wrapped as `TextResourceContents` |
| **Resource** | `SplFileObject` or `resource` | Base64-encoded as `BlobResourceContents` |
| **Resource** | `ReadResourceResult` | Returned as-is |
| **Resource template** | (same as Resource) | Template variables injected into the callback by name; return value normalized exactly like a resource |
| **Completion provider** | `string[]` | Wrapped as a `CompletionObject` (capped at 100, sets `hasMore`) |
| **Completion provider** | `CompletionObject` / `CompleteResult` | Returned as-is |

### PHP Type to JSON Schema Mapping

The reflection-based schema builder produces [JSON Schema draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) (the dialect the MCP spec assumes by default when a tool input schema omits `$schema`) using the following PHP-to-JSON-Schema type table. Pass an explicit `$inputSchema` to `tool()` if you need types or constraints this table can't express -- the SDK enforces only the spec-required envelope (top-level `type: object`, well-formed `properties` and `required`) and passes every other 2020-12 keyword through to the wire unchanged. See [Custom Input Schemas](#custom-input-schemas) for the full contract.

| PHP Type | JSON Schema Type |
|----------|-----------------|
| `string` | `"string"` |
| `int` | `"number"` |
| `float` | `"number"` |
| `bool` | `"boolean"` |
| `array` | `"array"` |
| `object` / `stdClass` | `"object"` |
