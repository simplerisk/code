/**
 * The SEP-2596 feature lifecycle (Active → Deprecated → Removed) as it
 * applies to this SDK: a mirror of the spec's deprecated-features registry
 * (`docs/specification/draft/deprecated.mdx`) for the features the SDK
 * implements, keyed by the revision in which each became Deprecated.
 *
 * SEP-2596 defines NO wire-level deprecation signal — deprecation is a
 * specification/schema/registry concern, and during the (minimum
 * twelve-month) deprecation window wire behavior is unchanged: deprecated
 * features keep working, capability negotiation is untouched, and no error
 * codes are introduced. The SDK obligations are language-native API
 * annotations (`@deprecated` docblocks) and the SHOULD-level runtime
 * warning this class backs: "Implementations SHOULD emit a runtime warning
 * when a deprecated feature is exercised" (SEP-2596), "Implementations
 * SHOULD emit a warning (e.g., in logs or developer tooling) when
 * deprecated capabilities are negotiated" (SEP-2577).
 *
 * A feature is Deprecated relative to a negotiated revision: exercising
 * Sampling on a `2025-11-25` session is NOT deprecated behavior (that
 * revision has it Active), so the warnings are gated on the session's
 * negotiated protocol version being at or past the deprecating revision.
