 * Exception thrown when an HTTP request times out at the transport level
 * (cURL CURLE_OPERATION_TIMEOUTED) without producing a response.
 *
 * Distinct from the generic transport RuntimeException so callers can
 * react to "the server never answered" specifically: the dual-era
 * negotiation (SEP-2575) treats a timed-out `server/discover` probe
 * as a silent legacy server and falls back to the initialize handshake,
 * while other transport failures (connection refused, TLS errors)
 * propagate.
